[["index.html", "A Concise Introduction to Survey Sampling Preface", " A Concise Introduction to Survey Sampling Trang Bui 2026-02-13 Preface Survey sampling is one of the fundamental subjects in statistics. Survey statisticians have early dealt with problems such as nonresponse, unrepresentative samples, selection bias, etc. such that the tools they developed for these problems have inspired many methods in missing data, causal inference, and even machine learning. This book aims provide a concise, easy-to-understand introduction to basic sampling principles and techniques and their corresponding inference methods. Although the book can be quite simple without advanced topics such as nonresponse, small area estimation, and selection bias correction, I hope it will still inspire you to appreciate the development of survey sampling theories and go further to incorporate survey sampling techniques into your research. Disclaimer: This book uses definitions and roughly follows the structure of Lohr (2021). Some sections of this book also share similar narratives with another book of mine. A few components are taken from the lecture notes of my colleague Shahedul Khan for the course STAT348: Sampling Techniques.

In these processes, we collect data from instances and try to generalize them into principles or conclusions that can be applied in other cases. Statistics is the branch of mathematics that studies such a process, namely data collection, analysis, and interpretation. Survey sampling is one of the fundamental subjects in statistics. In survey sampling, we are often interested in learning about a parameter of a target population. To understand what this means, we introduce some definitions: Observation unit: An object on which a measurement is taken. Variable of interest: The types of measurement taken on observation units that we want to study. Target population: The complete collection of observation units we want to study. This is also the collection of units that we want to make conclusions about. Parameter: A quantity that can be calculated from the variable of interest of the target population. Example 1.1 To better understand the above terminologies, let us consider an example where we are interested in how much students pay for rent. We will use this example throughout the book to illustrate different concepts in survey sampling. In this example, the variable of interest is the monthly rent expense. The observation units are students because we will “measure” their rent expenses. If we want to study the rent expense of all students in Canada, then our target population is all students who enroll in a Canadian university. A less ambitious target population is the student body of University of Saskatchewan. The parameter of our interest can be the average rent expense or the total dollar amount of rent paid by all students in the target population. Example 1.2 Another example is when an agricultural researcher want to estimate the yield of a crop. To do this, the researcher may want to grow that crop on multiple plots of land. The observation units are plots of land because we will “measure” the yield of a crop on those plots. Because the crop may have different yields at different environmental conditions, the possible target populations can be defined by locations. The researcher may want to get an estimate of the yield in the city of Saskatoon, or they want to get an estimate of the yield in the province of Saskatchewan, or a more ambitious goal will be the whole Canada. The parameter of our interest can be the average crop yield per acre. In survey sampling, we often assume that the population is finite1, and consists of \\(N &lt; \\infty\\) observation units. The population size \\(N\\) is also assumed to be fixed, although this assumption rarely holds in reality. Example 1.3 In 1.1, the USask student body may change every semester as current students graduate and new students enroll. 1.2 Census vs. Samples 1.2.1 Census To understand about the parameter of interest, we may try to collect data about every single observation unit in the target population. This is called a census. With a census, you can calculate the parameter of interest directly. A census also provides information on every subpopulation, no matter how small. Example 1.4 If we know the rent expense of every single student at USask, we will be able to calculate their average monthly rent expense directly. We will also be able calculate the average rent expense of every groups of students, for example, we will know the average students’ rent in every department. Notes: Many countries have censuses of birth and death records. In particular, Canada collect census data about its population every five years, often by sending invitation letters to all dwellings in Canada. Check out more information about Canadian censuses here. 1.2.2 Samples In many cases, due to constraints in cost, time, and other reasons, a census may not be possible. In this case, we may collect sample data. Sample: A subset of a population. Sampled population: The collection of all possible observation units that might have been chosen in a sample. This is the population from which the sample was taken. In practice, the sampled population rarely coincide with the target population (see Figure 1.1). Sampling unit: The unit that can be selected for a sample. Sometimes we want to study individuals but do not have a list of all individuals in the target distributions. In this case, the sampling unit may differ from the observation unit. Sampling frame: A list, map, or other specification of sampling units in the population from which a sample may be selected. Figure 1.1: Population and sample, from Figure 1.1. of Lohr (2021). Statistic: A quantity that can be calculated from the sample. We can use statistics to estimate or make conclusions about the population parameter. This process is called inference. In the next few chapters, we will consider (i) different sampling methods, then learn about (ii) how to make inferences in each of those sampling cases. Example 1.5 In the students’ rent example, we may decide to go to several randomly chosen classes on campus to interview students about their rent expenses. Here, the sampling frame is the list of all USask classes held this semester, and the sampling units are USask classes, instead of individual students. The sampled population are students who attend classes on the day we conduct our interviews. This excludes remote students, or thesis-writing students, for example. The sample is the actual students who were interviewed by us. The statistic can be the average rent payments made by these specific students. Since samples are much smaller than censuses, data collection for samples are often conducted with more care. Thus, if samples are collected in an appropriate manner, inferences from samples can be more reliable than censuses. 1.3 Variability and Bias A sampling protocol is a plan to collect sample data. Before learning different sampling method to devise a sampling protocol, we introduce the the concepts of variability and bias to identify what makes a good sampling protocol. 1.3.1 Variability In most cases, the list of observation units included in a sample is random, intentionally or not. The sample-to-sample difference (under the same sampling protocol) is called the variability of the sampling protocol. A sampling protocol with low variability is a sampling protocol with high precision. Example 1.6 Suppose I randomly choose one region in Saskatoon and then ask students in that region about their rent. In this case, my sampling protocol will have a high variability or a low precision. This is because if I repeat this same sample collecting method for many times, every time I will interview students living in a different region. Since rent will depend on specific regions and their distances to school, the rent data I collect will tend to be substantially different from one sample to another. 1.3.2 Bias The difference between the population data and the average of different samples (coming from the same sampling protocol) is called the bias of the sampling protocol. Small bias means high accuracy. Bias is often caused by systematic differences between the target population and sample. Example 1.7 Suppose I only interview female students. Even if I repeat this same sample collection method many times, I will only get the data that tells me about the rent expense for female students. This data will likely be different from the rent expense for all students. Hence I say the bias is high and accuracy is low. Figure 1.2 summarizes concepts about bias, variance, accuracy and precision. Figure 1.2: Accuracy and precision. Because we want to get an accurate and precise estimation of the population parameter, good sampling protocol should have low variance and low bias. You will learn from this course that we are usually able to reduce the variability by choosing an appropriate sampling method. On the other hand, bias is a much harder and more subtle problem to deal with. In practice, it can be even impossible to avoid bias. 1.4 Sources of Bias 1.4.1 Selection Bias Selection bias occurs when the target population does not coincide with the sampled population, or when some population units are sampled at a different rate than intended by the investigator. Some ways in which selection bias can occur are: convenience samples: when researchers conduct surveys on the first subset of population units they encounter; judgement samples: when researchers deliberately and intentionally select a “representative” sample; self-selected samples: when the sample only consists of volunteer; undercoverage: when the sampling frame fails to include some members of the target population; overcoverage: when units not in the target population can end up in the sample; nonresponse: when responses from some members of the chosen samples are not collected. Example 1.8 If we choose to interview our friends on their rent, because they are easier to interview, we are collecting a convenience sample. If we look at people walking on the street and use our judgement to determine who we think are spending the average rent and go to interview them, we are collecting a judgement sample. If we hang on posters around school to let students to come to us by themselves, we are collecting a self-selected sample. In all these cases, there can be systematic differences between students in our sample compared to students in the population. Our friends may have a similar spending patterns as us while other students may have different opinions. Our judgement can easily be misleading regarding who we think are paying the average rent. Finally, volunteers are usually more motivated by rewards and may have a different spending behavior compared to the rest of the students. When we interview students by visiting classes, we may miss people who do not come to class, remote students, graduate students who are writing their theses, medical residents, and so on. This induces undercoverage. When we send out emails with rewards for students to participate in our surveys, we may also end up collecting data from people who are not eligible but are motivated by the rewards and make up their eligibility. This leads us to the overcoverage problem. Even when we actually get to interview a student, they may choose not to disclose their information. These students can be more private and have a different rent selection than the one who reply to our interviews. Here, we run into a nonresponse problem. 1.4.2 Measurement Errors Measurement errors occur when the survey response has a tendency to differ from the true value. When such tendency is in one direction, we have measurement bias. Measurement errors can be caused by inaccuracy of measurement tools or devices unreliable respondents: people sometimes do not tell the truth people forget people do not always understand the questions etc. Example 1.9 In the crop yield case of Example 1.2, plants on adjacent plots can be counted twice, inducing measurement errors. Therefore, when conducting surveys, we should pay attention to our sampling protocol so that we get responses or measurements as accurate as possible. For surveys that require a measurement tool or device, such an equipment needs to get a thorough reliability check. When designing questionnaires to survey individuals, we should pay attention to details that may influence respondents’ responses, such as the order and wording of the questions, the list of options provided, the attitude of the interviewers, etc. For a quick guide on questionnaire design, check this tutorial. This is called the finite population assumption↩︎ "],["chap-srs.html", "2 Simple Probability Sampling 2.1 Mathematical Framework 2.2 Sampling Distribution 2.3 Unbiased Estimator 2.4 Probability Sampling 2.5 Poisson Sampling 2.6 Simple Random Sampling 2.7 Variance 2.8 Confidence Intervals 2.9 Sample Size Determination", " 2 Simple Probability Sampling 2.1 Mathematical Framework 2.1.1 Simplifying Assumptions Mathematics is ideal and beautiful and the world is messy. However, to study the world better, we must start with ideal, most simple cases, then build our theories upon that. From now on, we will assume that the sampled population is the same as the target population, and the sampling frame is complete. This implies that we assume that there is no nonresponse or missing data, no measurement error and no selection bias. 2.1.2 Population and Sample We represent the population by the sampling frame \\(U = \\{1, 2, ..., N\\}\\), where each index represents an observation unit. Then \\(U\\) is called the population index set. The letter \\(U\\) is used because the population can also be thought of as the universe that we are working on. As discussed in Section 1.2.2, a sample is a subset of the population. The sample is denoted by \\(S\\), where \\(S\\) stands for sample. Then \\(S \\subseteq U\\). Example 2.1 Suppose our population has 3 observation units. Then \\(U = \\{1, 2, 3\\}\\). The index \\(1\\) represents the first unit, the index \\(2\\) represents the second unit, and the index \\(3\\) represents the third unit. A sample \\(S\\) can be any subset of \\(U\\), so \\(S\\) can be \\(\\{1\\}, \\{1, 2\\}, \\{1, 2, 3\\}\\), or \\(\\{\\emptyset\\}\\), etc. 2.1.3 Variables A variable is a characteristic or quantity of the observation unit which can take different values. In the students’ rent Example 1.1, variables can be the monthly rent payment, age, department, etc. of students. General variables are often denoted by uppercase letters, for example, \\(X, Y, Z\\). Variables of a specific unit, say unit \\(i\\), is denoted by the uppercase letter accompanied by a subscript, e.g., \\(X_i, Y_i, Z_i\\). Actual values are denoted by lowercase letters \\(x_i, y_i, z_i\\). In survey sampling, there are often three types of variables: the variable of interest is often denoted by \\(Y\\). So in the population, we have \\(Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_N\\) denote the variable of interest measured on each unit. explanatory (or auxiliary) variables: some additional variables that can be helpful, but are not the variable of interest. They are often denoted by \\(X\\) (\\(X\\) can be a vector of different variables). Thus, in the population we have \\(X_1, ..., X_N\\). inclusion variable, often denoted by \\(Z\\), in which \\(Z_i\\) indicates whether unit \\(i\\) is included in the sample, that is \\[ Z_i = \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\text{if } i \\in S \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} \\] The set \\(\\{Z_1, ..., Z_N\\}\\) uniquely determines the set \\(S\\). Or equivalently, we can say that there is a 1-1 correspondence between \\(\\{Z_1, ..., Z_N\\}\\) and \\(S\\). Example 2.2 In the students’ rent Example 1.1, the monthly rent payment is the variable of interest, so it is denoted by \\(Y\\). Then, \\(Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_N\\) denote the monthly rent payment of the first, the second, …, the last student in the population, respectively. If the \\(i\\)-th student pays \\(\\$1,000\\) monthly for rent, then \\(y_i = 1,000\\). We use \\(y_i\\) to represent an actual number, but it can be any number. The explanatory variables can be a collection of information such as department, age, height, weight, etc. and are represented by \\(X\\). Finally, \\(Z_i\\) denotes whether the \\(i\\)-th student is included in our sample. Example 2.3 For each possible sample \\(S\\) from the population \\(U\\), we have a specific set of values for \\(\\{Z_1, ..., Z_N\\}\\). Continue from Example 2.1, if \\(U = \\{1, 2, 3\\}\\) then \\(S\\) and \\(Z_1, ..., Z_N\\) can take values: \\(S\\) \\(Z_1\\) \\(Z_2\\) \\(Z_3\\) \\(\\{\\emptyset\\}\\) \\(0\\) \\(0\\) \\(0\\) \\(\\{1\\}\\) \\(1\\) \\(0\\) \\(0\\) \\(\\{2\\}\\) \\(0\\) \\(1\\) \\(0\\) \\(\\{3\\}\\) \\(0\\) \\(0\\) \\(1\\) \\(\\{1,2\\}\\) \\(1\\) \\(1\\) \\(0\\) \\(\\{1,3\\}\\) \\(1\\) \\(0\\) \\(1\\) \\(\\{2,3\\}\\) \\(0\\) \\(1\\) \\(1\\) \\(\\{1,2,3\\}\\) \\(1\\) \\(1\\) \\(1\\) 2.1.4 Population Parameter and Sample Statistic Recall from Chapter 1, the parameter is a quantity that can be calculated from the population, and the statistic is a quantity that can be calculated from the sample. The goal of survey sampling is to estimate a population parameter using a sample statistic. For a collection of numbers \\(x_1, ..., x_m\\), common descriptive statistics that we can calculate are the mean and the variance, which is defined respectively as \\[ \\overline{x} = \\frac{1}{m}(x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_m) = \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^m x_i \\] \\[ s^2 = \\frac{1}{m-1}\\sum_{i=1}^m (x_i - \\overline{x})^2 \\] Example 2.4 Consider 3 numbers \\(4,10,7\\). Then the mean is \\[ \\overline{x} = \\frac{1}{3}(4+10+7) = 7 \\] The variance is \\[ s^2 = \\frac{1}{3-1} \\left[(4-7)^2 + (10-7)^2 + (7-7)^2\\right] = 9 \\] The standard deviation is \\(s = \\sqrt{s^2} = 3\\). Similarly, we can use these definitions to define our population parameters and sample statistics. Population parameters are functions of the variables of interest \\(Y_1, ..., Y_N\\). Often, we are interested in the population mean: \\[ \\overline{Y}_U = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N Y_i \\] When \\(Y_i\\) is an indicator i.e., a binary variable, then \\(\\overline{Y}_U\\) can the called the population proportion. For example, if \\(Y_i\\) indicates whether the \\(i\\)-th student has a private bathroom with \\(Y_i = 1\\) meaning the student has a private bathroom and \\(Y_i = 0\\) meaning the student does not have a private bathroom, then \\(\\overline{Y}_U\\) indicates the proportion of USask students who have a private bathroom. Or the population total \\[ T_U = \\sum_{i=1}^N Y_i = N\\overline{Y}_U \\] Sample statistics can be calculated from a sample, therefore, they are functions of \\(Z_iY_i\\), and possibly \\(Z_iX_i\\) for \\(i = 1, ..., N\\). Note here that we use \\(Z_iY_i\\) because, when unit \\(i\\) is included in our sample, \\(Z_i = 1\\) and \\(Z_iY_i = Y_i\\) so \\(Y_i\\) is incorporated in our sample statistic. On the other hand, if \\(Z_i = 0\\), unit \\(i\\) is not included in our sample, then \\(Z_iY_i = 0\\) contributes 0 to our sample statistic. Corresponding to the population parameters, we also have the sample mean. Suppose the sample we collected consists of \\(n\\) unit: \\[ \\overline{Y}_S = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i\\in S}Y_i = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^N Z_iY_i = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^N Z_iY_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^N Z_i} \\] We also have the sample total: \\[ T_S = \\sum_{i\\in S}Y_i = \\sum_{i=1}^N Z_iY_i \\] 2.1.5 Design-based Inference In survey sampling, we usually use a mathematical framework called design-based, which consists of the following assumptions The population size (the number of units in the population) \\(N\\) is fixed and finite. For each \\(i = 1, 2,..., N\\), \\(Y_i, X_i\\) is fixed, but possibly unknown to us. Therefore, \\(Y_i, X_i\\) can be replaced by lowercase letters \\(y_i, x_i\\). The sample \\(S\\) is random. Therefore \\(Z_1, ..., Z_N\\) are random. To differentiate with fixed quantities, we denote random quantities with uppercase letters. So \\(Z\\) is the only source of randomness in this framework. Since \\(Z\\) determines which unit is selected, the specification of \\(Z\\) is called the design of the sampling process. Thus, this framework is called the design-based framework2. The design-based framework is gaining its popularity back in fields beyond survey sampling, such as causal inference or economics. To understand the difference between fixed and random, we introduce the notion of a probabilistic experiment. A probabilistic experiment is a process in which the complexity of the underlying system leads to an outcome that cannot be known ahead of time. We say that the outcome of such a probabilistic experiment is random. Thus, the outcomes can be different each time the probabilistic experiment is repeated. In the design-based framework, we assume that there is only one probabilistic experiment, which is the sample selection process. That is, we do not know which unit will end up in our sample ahead of time, and if we repeat the sample selection process, we will probably get a different actual list \\(s\\) of units in our sample. Since \\(Z\\) is related to \\(S\\), \\(Z\\) is assumed to be random. Since \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\) is not related to the probabilistic experiment, they are assumed to be fixed. \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\) can be thought of as being inherent for our sampling units (think about the height and weight of a student). However, they are unknown to us because we did not collect our survey data about all units in the population. 2.2 Sampling Distribution 2.2.1 Probability Refresh Although there are different views of what a probability means, in this course, we will use the empirical (or frequentist) view, in which the probability of an outcome of a probabilistic experiment is the frequency that we obtain such an outcome, if we are to repeat the probabilistic experiment for an infinitely large number of times. In our case, the probabilistic experiment is the sample selection process, the outcome is the sample index set \\(S\\). So the probability that we obtain a specific value \\(s\\) of \\(S\\) is \\[ \\P(S = s) = \\lim_{\\text{number of repetitions} \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\text{number times outcome } s \\text{ is obtained}}{\\text{number of repetitions}} \\] A random variable \\(Z\\) is a function of the experimental outcome. The probability that the random variable \\(Z\\) attain a specific value \\(z\\) is the sum of probabilities of possible experimental outcomes \\(s\\) in which \\(Z = z\\), that is: \\[ \\P(Z = z) = \\sum_{s \\text{ so that when }S=s, \\text{ then }Z=z}\\P(S=s) \\] Check out this letcure to learn more about probability and its laws. Example 2.5 Continue with Example 2.3, suppose we repeat the sample selection process for a large amount of times, obtaining results \\[ \\{1\\}, \\{2,3\\}, \\{1,2\\}, \\{2,3\\}, \\{1,2\\}, \\{2\\}, \\{2\\}, \\{1,2\\}, \\{1\\}, ... \\] We then calculate the frequency of the possible outcomes obtained, then obtain the probability for each possible outcomes of \\(S\\), namely \\(\\{\\emptyset\\}, \\{1\\}, \\{2\\}, \\{3\\}, \\{1,2\\}, \\{1,3\\}, \\{2,3\\}, \\{1,2,3\\}\\) as follows: \\(S\\) \\(Z_1\\) \\(Z_2\\) \\(Z_3\\) \\(\\P(S=s)\\) \\(\\{\\emptyset\\}\\) \\(0\\) \\(0\\) \\(0\\) \\(0\\) \\(\\{1\\}\\) \\(1\\) \\(0\\) \\(0\\) \\(1/6\\) \\(\\{2\\}\\) \\(0\\) \\(1\\) \\(0\\) \\(1/3\\) \\(\\{3\\}\\) \\(0\\) \\(0\\) \\(1\\) \\(0\\) \\(\\{1,2\\}\\) \\(1\\) \\(1\\) \\(0\\) \\(1/3\\) \\(\\{1,3\\}\\) \\(1\\) \\(0\\) \\(1\\) \\(0\\) \\(\\{2,3\\}\\) \\(0\\) \\(1\\) \\(1\\) \\(1/6\\) \\(\\{1,2,3\\}\\) \\(1\\) \\(1\\) \\(1\\) \\(0\\) From here, we can calculate \\(\\P(Z_1 = 1)\\), i.e., the probability that unit 1 is in our sample, by summing up the probabilities of sample index sets that contain 1: \\[\\begin{align*} \\P(Z_1 = 1) &amp; = \\P(S = \\{1\\}) + \\P(S = \\{1,2\\}) + \\P(S = \\{1,3\\}) + \\P(\\{1,2,3\\}) \\\\ &amp; = 1/6 + 1/3 + 0 + 0 = 1/2 \\end{align*}\\] Similarly, the probability that unit 1 is not in our sample can be calculated by summing up the probabilities of possible sample index sets that do not contain 1: \\[\\begin{align*} \\P(Z_1 = 0) &amp; = \\P(S = \\{2\\}) + \\P(S = \\{3\\}) + \\P(S = \\{2,3\\}) + \\P(\\{\\emptyset\\}) \\\\ &amp; = 1/3 + 0 + 1/6 + 0 = 1/2 \\end{align*}\\] Since \\(Z_1\\) is a binary variable that can only takes 2 possible values: 1 or 0, so we can also use the probability law of complement to calculate \\(\\P(Z_1 = 0)\\): \\[ \\P(Z_1 = 0) = 1 - \\P(Z_1 = 1) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. \\] 2.2.2 Sampling Distribution Recall that in survey sampling, we try to use a sample statistic to estimate a population parameter, say \\(\\theta\\). In Section 2.1.4, we discussed that \\(\\theta\\) is a function of \\(Y_i\\), \\(i=1,...,N\\) and it can be, for example, the population sample or the population mean. Under the design-based framework discussed in Section 2.1.5, \\(Y_i\\) is assumed to be fixed, and \\(\\theta\\) is a function of \\(Y_i\\). As a consequence, \\(\\theta\\) is also assumed to be fixed. Thus, we can use lowercase letters to denote \\(\\theta\\). For example, the population total: \\[\\begin{equation} t_U = \\sum_{i=1}^N y_i \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] The population mean is \\[\\begin{equation} \\overline{y}_U = \\frac{1}{N}t_U = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N y_i \\tag{2.2} \\end{equation}\\] An estimator of \\(\\theta\\) is usually denoted with a hat: \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\). In Section 2.1.4, \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\) is a statistic calculated from the sample, so it is a function of \\(Z_iY_i\\) and possibly \\(Z_iX_i\\). In the design-based framework of Section 2.1.5, \\(Z_i\\) is assumed to be random, so \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\) is also random. Recall that we use lowercase letters to denote fixed and uppercase letters to denote random. So we write the sample total as \\[\\begin{equation} T_S = \\sum_{i \\in S} y_i = \\sum_{i=1}^N Z_iy_i \\tag{2.3} \\end{equation}\\] and write the sample mean as (if we have \\(n\\) units in our sample) \\[\\begin{equation} \\overline{Y}_S = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i\\in S}y_i = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^N Z_iy_i = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^N Z_iy_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^N Z_i} \\tag{2.4} \\end{equation}\\] We can see that the sample mean is a division of two random quantities, so it is more difficult than the sample total. So we will study the sample total and population total first. Again, \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\) is random due to the randomness from the sample selection probabilistic experiment. This implies that each time the probabilistic experiment is repeated, we will probably get a different value of \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\). The distribution formed by the frequency of possible values of \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\) when we repeat the sample selection processes infinitely many times is called the sampling distribution of \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\). The sampling distribution tells us about the probabilities that certain values/range of values of \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\) is obtained. Example 2.6 Continue with Example 2.5. Suppose that \\(Y_1 = 4\\), \\(Y_2 = 10\\), \\(Y_3 = 7\\). The population total is \\[ t_U = \\sum_{i=1}^3 Y_i = Y_1 + Y_2 + Y_3 = 4 + 10 + 7 = 21. \\] Consider the sample total \\(T_S = \\sum_{i=1}^N Z_i Y_i\\): \\(S\\) \\(Z_1\\) \\(Z_2\\) \\(Z_3\\) \\(\\P(S=s)\\) \\(T_S\\) \\(\\{\\emptyset\\}\\) \\(0\\) \\(0\\) \\(0\\) \\(0\\) \\(0\\) \\(\\{1\\}\\) \\(1\\) \\(0\\) \\(0\\) \\(1/6\\) \\(4\\) \\(\\{2\\}\\) \\(0\\) \\(1\\) \\(0\\) \\(1/3\\) \\(10\\) \\(\\{3\\}\\) \\(0\\) \\(0\\) \\(1\\) \\(0\\) \\(7\\) \\(\\{1,2\\}\\) \\(1\\) \\(1\\) \\(0\\) \\(1/3\\) \\(14\\) \\(\\{1,3\\}\\) \\(1\\) \\(0\\) \\(1\\) \\(0\\) \\(11\\) \\(\\{2,3\\}\\) \\(0\\) \\(1\\) \\(1\\) \\(1/6\\) \\(17\\) \\(\\{1,2,3\\}\\) \\(1\\) \\(1\\) \\(1\\) \\(0\\) \\(21\\) We can see that, depending on the actual sample we obtain from our sample selection process, \\(T_S\\) can have different values. Since the result of the sample selection process cannot be known beforehand and is random, the actual value of \\(T_S\\) as a result of the sample selection process, is also random. To visualize the sampling distribution of \\(T_S\\), we can draw a plot of the probabilities of different actual values of \\(T_S\\): plot(x = c(0, 4, 10, 7, 14, 11, 17, 21), y = c(0, 1/6, 1/3, 0, 1/3, 0, 1/6, 0), ylab = &quot;probability&quot;, xlab = &quot;possible values of T_S&quot;, main = &quot;Sampling distribution of T_S&quot;, type = &quot;h&quot;, lwd = 10) From the plot, we can see that \\[ \\P(T_S = 4) = 1/6; \\hspace{5mm} \\P(T_S = 10) = 1/3; \\hspace{5mm} \\P(T_S = 14) = 1/3; \\hspace{5mm} \\P(T_S = 17) = 1/6. \\] and the probability that \\(T_S\\) has other values outside of \\(4, 10, 14, 17\\) is 0. 2.2.3 Probabilistic Mean The (probabilistic) mean of a numerical-valued random variable is defined as \\[ \\E[Z] = \\sum_{\\text{possible values }z \\text{ of }Z} z \\times \\P(Z = z) \\] Example 2.7 Continue with Example 2.6, the expectation of random variable \\(Z_1\\) is \\[ \\E[Z_1] = 1 \\times \\P(Z_1 = 1) + 0 \\times \\P(Z_1 = 0) = 1 \\times 1/2 + 0 \\times 1/2 = 1/2. \\] Note here that for a binary random variable \\(Z\\) having only two possible outcomes \\(1\\) or \\(0\\), we always have \\[\\begin{equation} \\E[Z] = 1 \\times \\P(Z = 1) + 0 \\times \\P(Z = 0) = \\P(Z = 1). \\tag{2.5} \\end{equation}\\] Example 2.8 Continue with Example 2.6, we have \\[\\begin{align*} \\E[Z_2] = \\P(Z_2 = 1) &amp; = \\P(S = \\{2\\}) + \\P(S = \\{1,2\\}) + \\P(S = \\{2,3\\}) + \\P(S = \\{1,2,3\\}) \\\\ &amp; = 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/6 + 0 = 5/6. \\end{align*}\\] and \\[ \\E[Z_3] = \\P(Z_3 = 1) = 0 + 0 + 1/6 + 0 = 1/6. \\] 2.3 Unbiased Estimator 2.3.1 Bias Since sample statistics are random, which means it can obtain different values at different repetition of the sampling selection, we need to use the concepts of bias and variance in Section 1.3 to evaluate estimators. We will first look at bias. Mathematically, bias is defined as \\[ \\text{Bias}(\\widehat{\\theta}) = \\E[\\widehat{\\theta}] - \\theta \\] If \\(\\text{Bias}(\\widehat{\\theta}) = 0\\), we say \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\) is unbiased for \\(\\theta\\). Otherwise, we say that \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\) is biased for \\(\\theta\\). Example 2.9 Continue with Example 2.6, the expectation of the sample total \\(T_S\\) is \\[ \\E[T_S] = 4 \\times 1/6 + 10 \\times 1/3 + 14 \\times 1/3 + 17 \\times 1/6 = 11.5 \\] However, we want to estimate the population total, \\(t_U = 21\\). So the bias of \\(T_S\\) for \\(t_U\\) is \\[ \\E[T_S] - t_U = 11.5 - 21 = -9.5. \\] 2.3.2 Bias of Sample Total To calculate the bias formula of the sample total \\(T_S\\), we need to calculate its mean. In doing so, we use the following property: Proposition 2.1 (Linearity of Means) For random variables \\(Z_1\\), \\(Z_2\\), and constants (fixed numbers) \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), we have \\[ \\E[aZ_1 + bZ_2] = a\\E[Z_1] + b\\E[Z_2]. \\] In general, if we have \\(N\\) random variables \\(Z_1, ..., Z_N\\) and \\(N\\) constants \\(a_1, ..., a_N\\), we have \\[ \\E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^N a_iZ_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^N a_i\\E\\big[Z_i\\big]. \\] Basically, the linearity property of the means says that expectation (i.e., mean) of a linear combination of random variables equals the linear combination of the expectations (i.e., means) of the corresponding random variables. Applying Property 2.1 to the sample total, we have \\[ \\E\\big[T_S\\big] = \\E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^N Z_iy_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^N\\E\\big[Z_i\\big]y_i \\] where the first equation is from the definition in Equation (2.3), the second equation is from the linearity property of the mean and the design-based framework, which assumes that \\(y_i\\), \\(i=1, ..., N\\) are fixed (constants). So, the bias of the sample total \\(T_S\\) when estimating the population \\(t_U\\) is \\[ \\E\\big[T_S\\big] - t_U = \\sum_{i=1}^N\\E\\big[Z_i\\big]y_i - \\sum_{i=1}^Ny_i = \\sum_{i=1}^N\\Big\\{\\big(\\E[Z_i] - 1\\big)y_i\\Big\\} \\] which is often non-zero, meaning that \\(T_S\\) is often biased for \\(t_U\\). Furthermore, note that \\(Z_i\\), \\(i = 1, ..., N\\) are binary random variables which can only take one of two values, either 1 or 0, so from Equation (2.5), we have \\[ \\E\\big[Z_i\\big] = \\P(Z_i = 1) \\le 1 \\] Now, if \\(y_i \\ge 0\\) for all \\(i = 1, ..., N\\), for example, when \\(Y\\) is the monthly rent payment, then \\[ \\E\\big[T_S\\big] - t_U = \\sum_{i=1}^N\\Big\\{\\big(\\E[Z_i] - 1\\big)y_i\\Big\\} = \\sum_{i=1}^N\\Big\\{\\big[\\P(Z_i = 1) - 1\\big]y_i\\Big\\} \\le 0 \\] that is, \\(T_S\\) tends to underestimate \\(t_U\\) if \\(y_i \\ge 0\\) for all \\(i = 1, ..., N\\). This is what we have seen in Example 2.9. The only case where \\(T_S\\) is unbiased for \\(t_U\\) is when \\(\\Pr(Z_i = 1)\\) for all \\(i = 1, ..., N\\). This means that all units \\(i\\) in the population are included in our sample with certainty, implying that we are taking a census! 2.3.3 Horvitz-Thompson Estimator From the previous section, we notice that the sample total \\(T_S\\) is unbiased for the population total \\(t_U\\) only if we are taking a census. However, as discussed in Section 1.2.2, a census is usually impossible due to constraints in time, cost and other administrative issues. Thus, we cannot use the sample total to estimate the population total and we have to modify the sample total so that it become unbiased! For this, in 1952, the Horvitz-Thompson estimator is proposed: \\[\\begin{equation} \\widehat{T}_{HT} = \\sum_{i \\in S}\\frac{y_i}{\\P(Z_i = 1)} = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{Z_iy_i}{\\P(Z_i = 1)}. \\tag{2.6} \\end{equation}\\] Now, this estimator is unbiased: \\[ \\E\\big[\\widehat{T}_{HT}\\big] = \\E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{Z_iy_i}{\\P(Z_i = 1)}\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^N\\E[Z_i] \\frac{y_i}{\\P(Z_i = 1)} = \\sum_{i=1}^N y_i = t_U \\] since \\(\\E[Z_i] = \\Pr(Z_i = 1)\\), \\(i = 1, ..., N\\) by Equation (2.5). The Horvitz-Thompson estimator is an important mathematical discovery and is the basis for many methods in not only survey sampling but also missing data, causal inference, domain adaptation, etc. Example 2.6 Continue with Example 2.5. Suppose that \\(Y_1 = 4\\), \\(Y_2 = 10\\), \\(Y_3 = 7\\). The population total is \\[ t_U = \\sum_{i=1}^3 Y_i = Y_1 + Y_2 + Y_3 = 4 + 10 + 7 = 21. \\] From Examples 2.7 and 2.8, we also know that \\[ \\P(Z_1 = 1) = 1/2; \\hspace{5mm} \\P(Z_2 = 1) = 5/6; \\hspace{5mm} \\P(Z_3 = 1) = 1/6 \\] so we can calculate \\(S\\) \\(Z_1\\) \\(Z_2\\) \\(Z_3\\) \\(\\P(S=s)\\) \\(T_S\\) \\(\\widehat{T}_{HT}\\) \\(\\{\\emptyset\\}\\) \\(0\\) \\(0\\) \\(0\\) \\(0\\) \\(0\\) \\(0\\) \\(\\{1\\}\\) \\(1\\) \\(0\\) \\(0\\) \\(1/6\\) \\(4\\) \\(4/(1/2) = 8\\) \\(\\{2\\}\\) \\(0\\) \\(1\\) \\(0\\) \\(1/3\\) \\(10\\) \\(10/(5/6) = 12\\) \\(\\{3\\}\\) \\(0\\) \\(0\\) \\(1\\) \\(0\\) \\(7\\) \\(7/(1/6) = 42\\) \\(\\{1,2\\}\\) \\(1\\) \\(1\\) \\(0\\) \\(1/3\\) \\(14\\) \\(8+12= 20\\) \\(\\{1,3\\}\\) \\(1\\) \\(0\\) \\(1\\) \\(0\\) \\(11\\) \\(8+42=50\\) \\(\\{2,3\\}\\) \\(0\\) \\(1\\) \\(1\\) \\(1/6\\) \\(17\\) \\(12+42 = 54\\) \\(\\{1,2,3\\}\\) \\(1\\) \\(1\\) \\(1\\) \\(0\\) \\(21\\) \\(8+12+42 = 62\\) The expectation of the Horvitz-Thompson estimator is \\[ \\E\\big[\\widehat{T}_{HT}\\big] = 8 \\times \\frac{1}{6} + 12 \\times \\frac{1}{3} + 20 \\times \\frac{1}{3} + 54 \\times \\frac{1}{6} = 21 = t_U. \\] So we can see that although the Horvitz-Thompson estimator \\(\\widehat{T}_{HT}\\) also results in different values at different sample index set, but on average, it is unbiased for \\(t_U\\). This is like throwing darts, although the dart may land at different places, but the locations of the landings still surround the bullseye. On the other hand, the sample total \\(T_S\\) is biased (except for special cases). This is similar to throwing darts but the locations of the landings do not surround the bullseye. Check Figure 2.1 for a visual illustration. Figure 2.1: Visual illustration of biases of different estimators Based on the unbiased estimator \\(\\widehat{T}_{HT}\\) of the population total, the population mean can also be estimated unbiasedly using the estimator \\[\\begin{equation} \\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT} = \\frac{1}{N}\\widehat{T}_{HT} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N\\frac{Z_iy_i}{\\P(Z_i = 1)} \\tag{2.7} \\end{equation}\\] Exercise 2.1 Prove that \\(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT}\\) is unbiased for the population mean \\(\\overline{y}_U\\). Continue with Example 2.6, calculate \\(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT}\\) for each possible value \\(s\\) of \\(S\\). Then calculate \\(\\E\\big[\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT}\\big]\\). 2.3.4 Sampling Weights An important element of the Horvitz-Thompson estimator in Equation (2.6) is the probability \\(\\P(Z_i = 1)\\) for \\(i = 1, ..., n\\). We will use this probability a lot, so it will be convenient to give it a shorter notation. Denote \\(\\pi_i = \\P(Z_i = 1)\\) and call this the selection probability of unit \\(i\\). Denote \\(w_i = 1/\\pi_i\\) and call this the sampling weight of unit \\(i\\). Now we can write the Horvitz-Thompson estimator as \\[ \\widehat{T}_{HT} = \\sum_{i \\in S}\\frac{y_i}{\\pi_i} = \\sum_{i\\in S}w_iy_i \\] So, to estimate the population total, each response \\(y_i\\) of unit \\(i\\) is weighted by \\(w_i\\), that is, unit \\(i\\) needs to represent \\(w_i\\) units in the population. The Horvitz-Thompson estimator for the mean is then \\[ \\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT} = \\frac{1}{N}\\widehat{T}_{HT} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i \\in S}\\frac{y_i}{\\pi_i} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i\\in S}w_iy_i \\] 2.4 Probability Sampling In Section 2.1.5, we discuss that \\(Z\\) determines how the sample is obtained and is called the sampling design. In survey sampling, if we can design the sampling process, we can specify and know the probabilities \\(\\pi_i\\), \\(i=1, ..., N\\). As a result, we can use the Horvitz-Thompson estimator to obtain unbiased estimates! We call sampling designs in which we know the sampling probabilities \\(\\pi_i\\) for all units \\(i\\) in the population probability sampling. Non-probability sampling happens when we do not know the sampling probabilities for some (or all) of \\(\\pi_i\\). Examples include self-selection sampling, convenience sampling, and judgement sampling of Section 1.4.1. Note also that, the Horvitz-Thompson will not work if \\(\\pi_i = 0\\) for some \\(i \\in U\\) because we cannot divide by 0 when we calculate the expectation for \\(\\widehat{T}_{HT}\\)! In that case, we cannot use the Horvitz-Thompson estimator to correct for bias and need other (often stronger) assumptions. Note that \\(\\pi_i = 0\\) for some \\(i \\in U\\) means that there are some units in the population that we cannot reach at all. This implies we have undercoverage (refer to Section 1.4.1). 2.5 Poisson Sampling 2.5.1 The Design The easiest way to design a sampling scheme is to independently assign a probability \\(\\frac{n^*}{N}\\) of selection for each unit \\(i\\) in the population. To do so, we Determine a number \\(0 &lt; n^* \\le N\\). For each unit \\(i\\), independently3 toss a biased coin with \\(\\frac{n^*}{N}\\) chance of resulting in heads. If the result is head, then we select unit \\(i\\) in our sample. If not, we leave unit \\(i\\) out of our sample4. This design is called Poisson sampling5 in survey sampling context. In practice, we do not have a biased coin. But we can still do Poisson sampling using a computational software which has a random number generator: Determine a number \\(0 &lt; n^* \\le N\\). For each unit \\(i\\), independently generate a random variable between \\([0,1]\\), call this number \\(R\\). If \\(R \\le \\frac{n^*}{N}\\), then we select unit \\(i\\) in our sample. Otherwise, we leave unit \\(i\\) out of our sample. 2.5.2 The Estimator Under Poisson sampling, we know that \\(\\pi_i = \\frac{n^*}{N}\\), so we can use this to plug in the Horvitz-Thompson estimator formula in Equation (2.6) and get the estimator for population total: \\[ \\widehat{T}_{HT} = \\sum_{i \\in S}\\frac{y_i}{\\pi_i} = \\sum_{i \\in S}\\frac{y_i}{n^*/N} = \\frac{N}{n^*}\\sum_{i\\in S}y_i \\] and the estimator for population mean: \\[ \\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT} = \\frac{1}{N}\\widehat{T}_{HT} = \\frac{1}{n^*}\\sum_{i\\in S}y_i \\] Example 2.10 Suppose we design a Poisson sampling with \\(n^* = 2\\) for a population of 3 units \\(\\{U = 1, 2, 3\\}\\). Suppose \\(Y_1 = 4\\), \\(Y_2 = 10\\) and \\(Y_3 = 7\\). Then using the above formulas for \\(\\widehat{T}_{HT}\\) and \\(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT}\\): \\(S\\) \\(\\widehat{T}_{HT}\\) \\(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT}\\) \\(\\{\\emptyset\\}\\) \\(0\\) \\(0\\) \\(\\{1\\}\\) \\(4/(2/3) = 6\\) \\(6/3 = 4/2 = 2\\) \\(\\{2\\}\\) \\(10/(2/3) = 15\\) \\(15/3 = 10/2 = 5\\) \\(\\{3\\}\\) \\(7/(2/3) = 21/2\\) \\((21/2)/3 = 7/2 = 7/2\\) \\(\\{1,2\\}\\) \\(6+15 = 21\\) \\(21/3 = 14/2 = 7\\) \\(\\{1,3\\}\\) \\(6+21/2 = 33/2\\) \\((33/2)/3 = 11/2 = 11/2\\) \\(\\{2,3\\}\\) \\(15+21/2 = 51/2\\) \\((51/2)/3 = 17/2 = 17/2\\) \\(\\{1,2,3\\}\\) \\(6+15+21/2 = 63/2\\) \\((63/2)/3 = 21/2 = 21/2\\) The difference between between Examples 2.5 and 2.10 is that we did not know the probabilities \\(\\P(S = s)\\) for each possible realized sample index set \\(s\\). To calculate these probabilities, note that each \\(s\\) corresponds to a specific value \\(\\{z_1, ..., z_N\\}\\) of \\(\\{Z_1, ..., Z_N\\}\\). And we will also need to use the independence property of probabilities: Proposition 2.2 (Independence) If \\(Z_1, ..., Z_N\\) are independent from one another, \\[\\begin{align*} \\P(Z_1 = z_1, Z_2 = z_2, ..., Z_N = z_n) &amp; = \\P(Z_1 = z_1)\\times \\P(Z_2 = z_2) \\times ... \\times \\P(Z_n = z_n) \\\\ &amp; = \\prod_{i=1}^N \\P(Z_1 = z_1). \\end{align*}\\] We can apply this to Example 2.10. Example 2.11 Under Poisson sampling with \\(n^* = 2\\) and \\(N = 3\\), we have \\[ \\P(Z_1 = 1) = \\frac{2}{3}, \\hspace{5mm} \\P(Z_1 = 0) = 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\] Similarly, \\[ \\P(Z_2 = 1) = \\frac{2}{3}, \\hspace{5mm} \\P(Z_2 = 0) = \\frac{1}{3} \\] and \\[ \\P(Z_3 = 1) = \\frac{2}{3}, \\hspace{5mm} \\P(Z_3 = 0) = 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\] Therefore, we can calculate: \\(S\\) \\(Z_1\\) \\(Z_2\\) \\(Z_3\\) \\(\\P(S = s)\\) \\(\\{\\emptyset\\}\\) \\(0\\) \\(0\\) \\(0\\) \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{27}\\) \\(\\{1\\}\\) \\(1\\) \\(0\\) \\(0\\) \\(\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{27}\\) \\(\\{2\\}\\) \\(0\\) \\(1\\) \\(0\\) \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{27}\\) \\(\\{3\\}\\) \\(0\\) \\(0\\) \\(1\\) \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{2}{27}\\) \\(\\{1,2\\}\\) \\(1\\) \\(1\\) \\(0\\) \\(\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{4}{27}\\) \\(\\{1,3\\}\\) \\(1\\) \\(0\\) \\(1\\) \\(\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{4}{27}\\) \\(\\{2,3\\}\\) \\(0\\) \\(1\\) \\(1\\) \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{4}{27}\\) \\(\\{1,2,3\\}\\) \\(1\\) \\(1\\) \\(1\\) \\(\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{8}{27}\\) From Examples 2.10 and 2.11, we can see that all possible subsets \\(s\\) of \\(U\\) have non-zero probability of realization. That is, using Poisson sampling, all possible sizes, from \\(0\\) to \\(N\\), have some chance to occur. Thus, \\(n^*\\) does not necessarily equal to the actual number of units in the sample (i.e., \\(n \\ne n^*\\)), therefore \\[ \\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT} = \\frac{1}{n^*}\\sum_{i\\in S}y_i \\ne \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i\\in S}y_i. \\] Instead, \\(n^*\\) is the expected value of the sample size: \\[ \\E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^NZ_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\E[Z_i] = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{n^*}{N} = N\\times \\frac{n^*}{N} = n^*. \\] 2.6 Simple Random Sampling 2.6.1 Definition From Example 2.11, we can see that using Poisson sampling, we still have positive probabilities of sampling no one from the population (\\(S = \\emptyset\\)), or having to sample everyone from the population (\\(S = U\\)), which are not ideal. It would be better if we are able to set a fixed sample size \\(n\\) based on our budget constraints, for example. Furthermore, the HT estimator \\(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT}\\) does not necessary equal the sample mean \\(\\overline{Y}_S\\), which is not convenient. This motivates us to use simple random sampling (or simple random sampling without replacement), denoted as SRS a sampling method in which we select a predetermined sample size \\(n\\), then assign every possible subset of \\(n\\) distinct units in the population the same probability of happening. Example 2.12 Again, consider a population of 3 units, i.e., \\(U = \\{1,2,3\\}\\) in which \\(Y_1 = 4, Y_2 = 10\\) and \\(Y_3 = 7\\). Now, under simple random sampling, if we decide that our sample size should be \\(n = 2\\), then we have \\(S\\) \\(Z_1\\) \\(Z_2\\) \\(Z_3\\) \\(\\P(S = s)\\) \\(\\{\\emptyset\\}\\) \\(0\\) \\(0\\) \\(0\\) \\(0\\) \\(\\{1\\}\\) \\(1\\) \\(0\\) \\(0\\) \\(0\\) \\(\\{2\\}\\) \\(0\\) \\(1\\) \\(0\\) \\(0\\) \\(\\{3\\}\\) \\(0\\) \\(0\\) \\(1\\) \\(0\\) \\(\\{1,2\\}\\) \\(1\\) \\(1\\) \\(0\\) \\(1/3\\) \\(\\{1,3\\}\\) \\(1\\) \\(0\\) \\(1\\) \\(1/3\\) \\(\\{2,3\\}\\) \\(0\\) \\(1\\) \\(1\\) \\(1/3\\) \\(\\{1,2,3\\}\\) \\(1\\) \\(1\\) \\(1\\) \\(0\\) That is, there are three possible subsets \\(s \\subseteq U\\) that contain 2 units, so we assign a probability of \\(1/3\\) to each of them, and assign \\(0\\) probability to any other possible subsets. In this case, we have \\[ \\pi_1 = P(Z_1 = 1) = P(S = \\{1,2\\}) + P(S = \\{1,3\\}) = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3} \\] \\[ \\pi_2 = P(Z_2 = 1) = P(S = \\{1,2\\}) + P(S = \\{2,3\\}) = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3} \\] \\[ \\pi_3 = P(Z_3 = 1) = P(S = \\{1,3\\}) + P(S = \\{2,3\\}) = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3} \\] We can see that, in Example 2.12, \\(\\pi_i\\) are the same for every unit \\(i \\in U\\). This is not a coincidence. In fact, in simple random sampling, the selection probability is \\[\\begin{equation} \\pi_i = \\frac{n}{N}, \\hspace{5mm} \\text{for all } i = 1, 2, ..., N \\tag{2.8} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(n\\) is our pre-specified sample size. As a result, the weights \\(w_i = 1/\\pi_i\\) are also the same for all units \\(i = 1, ..., N\\). Therefore, simple random sampling is also self-weighting. We can prove that \\(\\pi_i = n/N\\) for any \\(i = 1, ..., N\\) and arbitrary \\(N\\) and \\(n \\le N\\). Proof. First, we notice that there are \\(\\left( \\begin{array}{c} N \\\\ n \\end{array} \\right)\\) possible subsets of \\(n\\) distinct units from a population of \\(N\\) units. This is because we are choosing \\(n\\) units without replacement from a set of \\(N\\) units6. Under simple random sampling, we assign equal probabilities to these subsets, so we have \\[ P(S = s) = \\begin{cases} 1/\\left( \\begin{array}{c} N \\\\ n \\end{array} \\right) &amp; \\text{if } s \\text{ has } n \\text{ units} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} \\] There are \\(\\left( \\begin{array}{c} N-1 \\\\ n-1 \\end{array} \\right)\\) possible subsets of \\(n\\) units that contain unit \\(i\\). This is because, to create a subset of size \\(n\\) that contains unit \\(i\\), we first choose unit \\(i\\) and put it into our subset. We are then left with \\(N-1\\) units from the population to choose from, and \\(n-1\\) empty places in our subset. So the number of ways to choose units for the remaining \\(n-1\\) places is \\(\\left( \\begin{array}{c} N-1 \\\\ n-1 \\end{array} \\right)\\). This is also the number of possible subsets of \\(n\\) distinct units that contain unit \\(i\\). In summary, we have \\(\\left( \\begin{array}{c} N \\\\ n \\end{array} \\right)\\) possible subsets of \\(n\\) distinct units, each having \\(1/\\left( \\begin{array}{c} N \\\\ n \\end{array} \\right)\\) chance of happening. Among those subsets, there are \\(\\left( \\begin{array}{c} N-1 \\\\ n-1 \\end{array} \\right)\\) subsets that contain unit \\(i\\). Therefore, \\[ P(Z_i = 1) = \\left( \\begin{array}{c} N-1 \\\\ n-1 \\end{array} \\right) \\times \\frac{1}{\\left( \\begin{array}{c} N \\\\ n \\end{array} \\right)} = \\frac{n}{N} \\] This applies to any unit \\(i\\) in the population. So \\(\\pi_i = n/N\\) for all \\(i = 1, ..., N\\). 2.6.2 The Estimator Using the results for \\(\\pi_i\\), we can derive the HT estimators for the population mean and population total under simple random sampling: \\[ \\widehat{T}_{HT} = \\sum_{i \\in S}\\frac{y_i}{\\pi_i} = \\sum_{i \\in S}\\frac{y_i}{n/N} = \\frac{N}{n}\\sum_{i\\in S}y_i \\] \\[ \\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT} = \\frac{1}{N}\\widehat{T}_{HT} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i\\in S}y_i = \\overline{Y}_S \\] So, using simple random sampling, the Horvitz-Thompson estimator for the population mean is the sample mean itself! This is more intuitive and convenient, compared to Poisson sampling! 2.6.3 The Design There are multiple ways to obtain a simple random sample, say, of sample size \\(n\\). The first method is called systematic sampling, which proceeds as follows: shuffle the population index set \\(U\\), calculate \\(k = \\lceil N/n \\rceil\\), called the ceiling of \\(N/n\\), which is the smallest integer that is greater or equal to \\(N/n\\), Find a random integer \\(R\\) between 1 and \\(k\\) Choose units \\(R, R+k, R+2k, ..., R+(n-1)k\\) into our sample. That is, from the starting point of \\(R\\), the sampled units will be equally spaced by \\(k\\) from each other in the shuffled index set. Example 2.13 Suppose we are interested in obtain an SRS sample of \\(n=4\\) units from a population of \\(N=30\\) units. First, we shuffle the index set \\(U = \\{1, 2, ..., 30\\}\\), and obtain, for example, \\[\\begin{equation} 4,16,13,17,24,26,30,22,6,1,18,27,12,23,14,\\\\ 25,29,5,10,15,21,11,9,20,7,28,3,8,19,2 \\end{equation}\\] Since \\(N/n = 30/4 = 7.5\\), the smallest integer that is greater or equal to \\(7.5\\) is 8, so \\(k = 8\\). We then find a random integer \\(R\\) between \\(1\\) and \\(k\\). Suppose we randomize and get \\(R = 5\\). From the shuffled index set, we first choose the \\(R = 5\\)th index, then the \\(R+k = 13\\)th index, the \\(R+2k = 21\\) index, and finally the \\(R+(n-1)k = 5 + (4-1)8 = 29\\)th index, which is \\[\\begin{equation} 4,16,13,17,\\color{red}{24},26,30,22,6,1,18,27,\\color{red}{12},23,14,\\\\ 25,29,5,10,15,\\color{red}{21},11,9,20,7,28,3,8,\\color{red}{19},2 \\end{equation}\\] The second method, which is more computer friendly, is to generate \\(n\\) random numbers in \\([0,1]\\) Multiply each number by \\(N\\) Round the result up to the next integer If there are duplicates, re-generate a new random number! Basically, what this does is to divide the range \\([0,1]\\) into \\(N\\) equally spaced intervals. We then randomize a number to see which interval contains that number. If the number falls into the \\(i\\)th interval, then we select that unit into our sample. If two random numbers both fall into the \\(i\\)th interval, we can select unit \\(i\\) into our sample, and generate another random number, which may fall into another interval that we did not add into our sample. Figure 2.2: Visual illustration of interval-based SRS technique The third method, which is very convenient in R, is to use the function sample() sample(1:N, size = n, replace = FALSE) #where N and n are numbers from your survey design For example, in Example 2.13, instead of systematic sampling, we can use R sample(1:30, size = 4, replace = FALSE) ## [1] 12 11 9 13 2.7 Variance 2.7.1 Definition So far, we have discussed about biases and how we can use the Horvitz-Thompson-estimator to obtain unbiased estimators of the population mean and population total. Looking at Figure1.2, another aspect of estimators that we need to consider is variance. Variance tells us how each run of an experiment is different from the overall average. Mathematically, it is defined as \\[ Var(Z) = \\E[(Z - \\E[Z])^2], \\] for any random variable \\(Z\\). Besides, we also have the definition of the covariance between two random variables \\(Z_1, Z_2\\): \\[ Cov(Z_1, Z_2) = \\E[(Z_1 - \\E[Z_1])(Z_2 - \\E[Z_2])]. \\] Therefore, \\[ Var(Z_1) = Cov(Z_1, Z_1). \\] We can prove that for any random variables \\(Z_1, Z_2\\): \\[\\begin{equation} Cov(Z_1, Z_2) = \\E[Z_1Z_2] - \\E[Z_1]\\E[Z_2]. \\tag{2.9} \\end{equation}\\] . Proof. \\[\\begin{align*} Cov(Z_1, Z_2) &amp; = \\E[(Z_1 - \\E[Z_1])(Z_2 - \\E[Z_2])] \\\\ &amp; = \\E[(Z_1Z_2 - Z_1\\E[Z_2] - \\E[Z_1]Z_2 + \\E[Z_1]\\E[Z_2])] \\\\ &amp; = \\E[Z_1Z_2] - \\E[Z_1]\\E[Z_2] - \\E[Z_1]\\E[Z_2] + \\E[Z_1]\\E[Z_2] \\\\ &amp; = \\E[Z_1Z_2] - \\E[Z_1]\\E[Z_2]. \\end{align*}\\] Therefore \\(Var(Z_1) = Cov(Z_1, Z_1) = \\E[Z_1^2] - (\\E[Z_1])^2\\) for any random variable \\(Z_1\\). 2.7.2 Variance of Horvitz-Thompson Estimators First, we will start with the Horvitz-Thompson (HT) estimator \\(\\widehat{T}_{HT}\\) for the population total. To derive this variance, we use the variance formula for a linear combination of random variables: \\[\\begin{equation} Var\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^Na_iZ_i\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^N a_i^2 Var(Z_i) + 2\\sum_{i \\ne j}a_ia_j Cov(Z_i,Z_j). \\tag{2.10} \\end{equation}\\] Proof. For two random variables \\(Z_1\\) and \\(Z_2\\) and constants \\(a_1\\), \\(a_2\\): \\[\\begin{align*} &amp; Var(a_1Z_1 + a_2Z_2) \\\\ &amp; = \\E\\Big[\\big\\{(a_1Z_1 +a_2Z_2) - \\E[a_1Z_1 + a_2Z_2]\\big\\}^2\\Big] \\\\ &amp; = \\E\\Big[\\big\\{(a_1Z_1 - \\E[a_1Z_1]) + (a_2Z_2 - \\E[a_2Z_2])\\big\\}^2\\Big] \\\\ &amp; = \\E\\Big[\\big\\{(a_1Z_1 - \\E[a_1Z_1])^2 + 2(a_1Z_1 - \\E[a_1Z_1])(a_2Z_2 - \\E[a_2Z_2]) + (a_2Z_2 - \\E[a_2Z_2])^2\\big\\}\\Big] \\\\ &amp; = \\E\\Big[(a_1Z_1 - \\E[a_1Z_1])^2\\Big] + 2\\E\\Big[(a_1Z_1 - \\E[a_1Z_1])(a_2Z_2 - \\E[a_2Z_2])] + \\E\\Big[(a_2Z_2 - \\E[a_2Z_2])^2\\Big] \\\\ &amp; = a_1^2Var(Z_1) + 2a_1a_2Cov(Z_1,Z_2) + a_2^2Var(Z_2) \\end{align*}\\] We can then use mathematical induction to prove the case for a linear combination of \\(N\\) random variables. Here, \\(\\sum_{i \\ne j} \\equiv \\sum_{i=1}^N\\sum_{j=i+1}^N\\), meaning we are summing over all pairs \\(i, j\\) so that \\(i \\ne j\\). Now, we apply Equations (2.10) and (2.9) to get \\[\\begin{align*} Var(\\widehat{T}_{HT}) &amp; = Var\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{Z_iy_i}{\\pi_i}\\right) \\\\ &amp; = \\sum_{i=1}^N\\frac{y_i^2}{\\pi_i^2}Var(Z_i) + 2\\sum_{i\\ne j}\\frac{y_iy_j}{\\pi_i\\pi_j}Cov(Z_i, Z_j) \\\\ &amp; = \\sum_{i=1}^N\\frac{y_i^2}{\\pi_i^2}\\pi_i(1-\\pi_i) + 2\\sum_{i\\ne j}\\frac{y_iy_j}{\\pi_i\\pi_j}(\\E[Z_iZ_j] - \\pi_i\\pi_j) \\tag{2.11} \\end{align*}\\] where the last equation is because \\(Z_i\\) is a binary random variable, thus \\(Z_i = Z_i^2\\) and \\(\\E[Z_i] = \\P(Z_i = 1) = \\pi_i\\), thus \\[ Var(Z_i) = \\E[Z_i^2] - (\\E[Z_i])^2 = \\E[Z_i] - (\\E[Z_i])^2 = \\pi_i - \\pi_i^2 = \\pi_i(1-\\pi_i) \\] and \\[ Cov(Z_i, Z_j) = \\E[Z_iZ_j] - \\E[Z_i]\\E[Z_j] = \\E[Z_iZ_j] - \\pi_i\\pi_j. \\] And the variance of \\(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT}\\) is \\[\\begin{equation} Var(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT}) = Var\\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\widehat{T}_{HT}\\right) = \\frac{1}{N^2}Var(\\widehat{T}_{HT}) \\tag{2.12} \\end{equation}\\] 2.7.3 Variance under Simple Random Sampling In the case of simple random sampling of Section 2.6, we have \\(\\pi_i = n/N\\) and \\[ \\E[Z_iZ_j] = \\P(Z_iZ_j = 1) = \\P(Z_i = 1, Z_j = 1) = \\left( \\begin{array}{c} N-2 \\\\ n-2 \\end{array} \\right) \\times \\frac{1}{\\left( \\begin{array}{c} N \\\\ n \\end{array} \\right)} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{N(N-1)} \\] since \\(Z_1\\) and \\(Z_2\\) are binary random variables so \\(Z_1Z_2\\) are also binary random variables. Also, \\(Z_i = 1\\) and \\(Z_j = 1\\) happens at the same time if both units \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) are included in our sample. This is the same as fixing units \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) in our sample and having \\(N-2\\) units left to choose from to fill \\(n-2\\) remaining positions in our sample. Plugging the above formulas for \\(\\pi_i\\) and \\(\\E[Z_iZ_j]\\) under SRS to the variance formula of the Horvitz-Thompson estimator in Equation (2.11), we have \\[\\begin{equation} Var(\\widehat{T}_{HT}) = N^2\\left(1-\\frac{n}{N}\\right)\\frac{s_U^2}{n}. \\tag{2.13} \\end{equation}\\] Proof. \\[\\begin{align*} Var(\\widehat{T}_{HT}) &amp; = \\sum_{i=1}^N\\frac{y_i^2}{\\pi_i^2}\\pi_i(1-\\pi_i) + 2\\sum_{i\\ne j}\\frac{y_iy_j}{\\pi_i\\pi_j}(\\E[Z_iZ_j] - \\pi_i\\pi_j) \\\\ &amp; = \\sum_{i=1}^N\\frac{y_i^2}{n^2/N^2}\\frac{n}{N}\\left(1-\\frac{n}{N}\\right) + 2\\sum_{i\\ne j}\\frac{y_iy_j}{n^2/N^2}\\left(\\frac{n(n-1)}{N(N-1)} - \\frac{n^2}{N^2}\\right) \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{N-n}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^Ny_i^2 + 2\\frac{-(N-n)}{n(N-1)}\\sum_{i\\ne j}y_iy_j \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{(N-n)}{n(N-1)}\\left\\{(N-1)\\sum_{i=1}^Ny_i^2 - 2\\sum_{i\\ne j}y_iy_j\\right\\} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{(N-n)}{n(N-1)}\\left\\{N\\sum_{i=1}^Ny_i^2 - \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^Ny_i^2 + 2\\sum_{i\\ne j}y_iy_j\\right)\\right\\} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{(N-n)}{n(N-1)}\\left\\{N\\sum_{i=1}^Ny_i^2 - \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^Ny_i\\right)^2\\right\\} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{N(N-n)}{n(N-1)}\\left\\{\\sum_{i=1}^Ny_i^2 - N\\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^Ny_i\\right)^2\\right\\} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{N(N-n)}{n(N-1)}\\left\\{\\sum_{i=1}^Ny_i^2 - N\\overline{y}_U^2\\right\\} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{N(N-n)}{n(N-1)}\\left\\{\\sum_{i=1}^Ny_i^2 - 2N\\overline{y}_U^2 + N\\overline{y}_U^2\\right\\} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{N(N-n)}{n(N-1)}\\left\\{\\sum_{i=1}^Ny_i^2 - 2\\overline{y}_U\\sum_{i=1}^Ny_i + \\sum_{i=1}^N\\overline{y}_U^2\\right\\} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{N(N-n)}{n(N-1)}\\left\\{\\sum_{i=1}^N(y_i^2 - 2y_i\\overline{y}_U + \\overline{y}_U^2)\\right\\} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{N(N-n)}{n(N-1)}\\left\\{\\sum_{i=1}^N(y_i - \\overline{y}_U)^2 \\right\\} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{N(N-n)}{n}s_U^2 \\\\ &amp; = N^2\\left(1-\\frac{n}{N}\\right)\\frac{s_U^2}{n} \\end{align*}\\] where \\(s_U^2 = \\frac{1}{N-1}\\sum_{i=1}^N(y_i - \\overline{y}_U)^2\\) is the population variance. Plugging the variance of \\(\\widehat{T}_{HT}\\) in Equation (2.14) into the variance formula of the HT estimator \\(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT}\\) for the population mean in Equation (2.12), we have the variance of the HT estimator \\(\\overline{Y}_S = \\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT}\\) for the population mean under SRS: \\[\\begin{equation} Var(\\overline{Y}_S) = \\frac{1}{N^2}Var(\\widehat{T}_{HT}) = \\left(1-\\frac{n}{N}\\right)\\frac{s_U^2}{n}. \\tag{2.14} \\end{equation}\\] In Equations (2.13) and (2.14), the factor \\(1-\\frac{n}{N}\\) is called the finite population correction (or FPC). This is because if \\(N\\) is not finite, i.e., infinite, and \\(n\\) is fixed, then this factor will become 1 and the variance of \\(\\overline{Y}_S\\) will be \\(s_U^2/n = \\sigma^2/n\\), which is the variance of \\(\\overline{Y}_S = 1/n\\sum_{i=1}^nY_i\\) where we assume that \\(Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_n\\) are randomly drawn from a distribution7 of variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). 2.7.4 Variance Estimators In Equations (2.13) and (2.14), the variance formulas involve a population quantity \\(s_U^2\\), which requires all units in the population. However, we will not know these units unless we sample them and collect data from them! Therefore, we need to estimate the variance of the HT estimators \\(\\widehat{T}_{HT}\\) and \\(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT}\\) from the sample. In fact, under SRS, the sample variance \\(S_S^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i\\in S}(y_i - \\overline{Y}_S)^2\\) is an unbiased estimator of the population variance \\(s_U^2\\). Proof. We want to prove \\[ \\E[S_S^2] = \\E\\left[\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i\\in S}(y_i - \\overline{Y}_S)^2\\right] = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\E\\left[\\sum_{i\\in S}(y_i - \\overline{Y}_S)^2\\right] = s_U^2, \\] which is equivalent to proving \\(\\E\\left[\\sum_{i\\in S}(y_i - \\overline{Y}_S)^2\\right] = s_U^2\\). This is because: \\[\\begin{align*} \\E\\left[\\sum_{i\\in S}(y_i - \\overline{Y}_S)^2\\right] &amp; = \\E\\Big[\\sum_{i\\in S}\\big(\\{y_i - \\overline{y}_U\\} - \\{\\overline{Y}_S - \\overline{y}_U\\}\\big)^2\\Big] \\\\ &amp; = \\E\\Big[\\sum_{i\\in S}\\big(\\{y_i - \\overline{y}_U\\}^2 - 2\\{y_i - \\overline{y}_U\\}\\{\\overline{Y}_S - \\overline{y}_U\\} + \\{\\overline{Y}_S - \\overline{y}_U\\}^2\\big)\\Big] \\\\ &amp; = \\E\\Big[\\sum_{i\\in S}\\{y_i - \\overline{y}_U\\}^2 - 2\\{\\overline{Y}_S - \\overline{y}_U\\}\\sum_{i\\in S}\\{y_i - \\overline{y}_U\\} + n\\{\\overline{Y}_S - \\overline{y}_U\\}^2\\Big] \\\\ &amp; = \\E\\Big[\\sum_{i\\in S}\\{y_i - \\overline{y}_U\\}^2 - 2n\\{\\overline{Y}_S - \\overline{y}_U\\}^2 + n\\{\\overline{Y}_S - \\overline{y}_U\\}^2\\Big] \\\\ &amp; = \\E\\Big[\\sum_{i\\in S}\\{y_i - \\overline{y}_U\\}^2 - n\\{\\overline{Y}_S - \\overline{y}_U\\}^2\\Big] \\\\ &amp; = \\E\\Big[\\sum_{i\\in S}\\{y_i - \\overline{y}_U\\}^2\\Big] - n\\Big[\\{\\overline{Y}_S - \\overline{y}_U\\}^2\\Big] \\\\ &amp; = \\E\\Big[\\sum_{i=1}^NZ_i\\{y_i - \\overline{y}_U\\}^2\\Big] - nVar(\\overline{Y}_S) \\\\ &amp; = \\sum_{i=1}^N(\\E[Z_i]\\{y_i - \\overline{y}_U\\}^2) - nVar\\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\widehat{T}_{HT}\\right) \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{n}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N\\{y_i - \\overline{y}_U\\}^2 - \\frac{n}{N^2}Var\\left(\\widehat{T}_{HT}\\right) \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{n}{N}(N-1)s_U^2 - \\frac{n}{N^2}N^2\\left(1-\\frac{n}{N}\\right)\\frac{s_U^2}{n} \\\\ &amp; = (n-1)s_U^2, \\end{align*}\\] where the 7th equation is because under SRS, \\(\\overline{Y}_S\\) is an unbiased estimator for \\(\\overline{y}_U\\), so \\(\\overline{y}_U = \\E[\\overline{Y}_S]\\); and the 10th equation is obtained by applying Equation (2.13). Therefore, under SRS, we can estimate the variance of the HT estimators \\(\\widehat{T}_{HT}\\) and \\(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT}\\) by \\[\\begin{equation} \\widehat{Var}(\\widehat{T}_{HT}) = N^2\\left(1-\\frac{n}{N}\\right)\\frac{S_S^2}{n}. \\tag{2.15} \\end{equation}\\] and \\[\\begin{equation} \\widehat{Var}(\\overline{Y}_S) = \\frac{1}{N^2}Var(\\widehat{T}_{HT}) = \\left(1-\\frac{n}{N}\\right)\\frac{S_S^2}{n}. \\tag{2.16} \\end{equation}\\] Exercise 2.2 Derive the variance formula for the HT estimators under Poisson sampling, using the fact that if \\(Z_i\\) and \\(Z_j\\) are independent, then \\(Cov(Z_i, Z_j) = 0\\). Suggest an estimator for the variance of the HT estimators under Poisson sampling. Hint: using an HT estimator for the variance itself! The standard error of an estimator \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\) is defined as the square root of the variance, that is \\(SE(\\widehat{\\theta}) = \\sqrt{Var(\\widehat{\\theta})}\\). Therefore, the standard errors of the HT estimators for population total and populaton mean under SRS can be estimated by taking the square root of the formula in Equations (2.15) and (2.16), which gives \\[\\begin{equation} \\widehat{SE}(\\widehat{T}_{HT}) = N\\sqrt{1-\\frac{n}{N}}\\frac{S_S}{\\sqrt{n}}. \\tag{2.17} \\end{equation}\\] and \\[\\begin{equation} \\widehat{SE}(\\overline{Y}_S) = N\\sqrt{1-\\frac{n}{N}}\\frac{S_S}{\\sqrt{n}}. \\tag{2.18} \\end{equation}\\] Note here the difference between the standard error \\(SE\\), which is the square root of the variance of an estimator, and the standard deviation \\(S_S\\) or \\(s_U\\), which is the square toot of the observations \\(y\\) in our sample or population, respectively. Example 2.14 Take an SRS of 4 units from a population of 10 units and obtain \\(y_1 = 2\\), \\(y_2 = 6\\), \\(y_3=3\\), \\(y_4=10\\). The HT estimator for the population mean \\(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT}\\), i.e., the sample mean \\(\\overline{Y}_S\\) (since we are sampling under SES), is \\[ \\overline{Y}_S = \\frac{1}{4}(2+6+3+10) = \\frac{21}{4} \\] The sample variance is \\[ S_S^2 = \\frac{1}{4-1}\\left\\{\\left(2-\\frac{21}{4}\\right)^2 + \\left(6-\\frac{21}{4}\\right)^2 + \\left(3-\\frac{21}{4}\\right)^2 + \\left(10-\\frac{21}{4}\\right)^2\\right\\} = 12.9167 \\] The variance of the sample mean is \\[ \\widehat{Var}(\\overline{Y}_S) = \\left(1-\\frac{4}{10}\\right)\\frac{12.9167}{4} = 1.9375 \\] The standard deviation is \\[ \\widehat{SE}(\\overline{Y}_S) = \\sqrt{1.9375} = 1.3919 \\] We can also use survey package in R to calculate the HT estimates, which are the realized values of the estimators on a specific sample. Suppose your sample is stored in variable y of a dataset called your_sample. y &lt;- your_data your_sample &lt;- data.frame(y = y) #here, the left-hand side of y=y is the name of the variable #the right-hand side of y=y is the vector that contains your data First, we need to specify the SRS design library(survey) design.srs &lt;- svydesign(ids = ~1, data = your_sample, fpc = ~rep(N,n)) Then use the following commands to obtain the estimate for population mean svymean(x = ~y, design = design.srs) The estimate for population total can be obtained by svytotal(x = ~y, design = design.srs) Example 2.15 Continue with Example 2.14, we can use R to obtain our estimates: library(survey) y &lt;- c(2,6,3,10) your_sample &lt;- data.frame(y = y) design.srs &lt;- svydesign(ids = ~1, data = your_sample, fpc = ~rep(10,4)) svymean(x = ~y, design = design.srs) ## mean SE ## y 5.25 1.3919 This gives the same results as our calculation in Example 2.14. Proportion is a special case of means, where the variable of interest \\(Y\\) is binary, for example, whether a student has a private washroom at their residence. Let \\(p_U\\) denote the population proportion and \\(\\widehat{P}_S\\) denote the sample proportion. Note that \\[ \\overline{Y}_S = \\widehat{P}_S = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^ny_i = \\frac{\\text{# of units } i \\text{ so that }y_i=1}{n} \\] Then with some algebra, we can prove that \\[\\begin{equation} s_U^2 = \\frac{N}{N-1}p_U(1-p_U) \\tag{2.19} \\end{equation}\\] Proof. Since \\(y_i\\)’s are binary, we have \\[\\begin{align*} s_U^2 &amp; = \\frac{1}{N-1}\\sum_{i=1}^N(y_i - p_U)^2 \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{1}{N-1} \\left(\\sum_{i: y_i = 0}p_U^2 + \\sum_{i: y_i = 1}(1-p_U)^2\\right) \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{1}{N-1} \\left(p_U^2N(1-p_U) + (1-p_U)^2Np_U\\right) \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{1}{N-1}Np_U(1-p_U)(p_U + 1-p_U) \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{N}{N-1}p_U(1-p_U) \\end{align*}\\] where the third equation is because we are summing over all unit \\(i\\)’s such that \\(y_i = 0\\), and there are \\(N(1-p_U)\\) such units in the population. Similarly, we are summing over \\(Np_U\\) units with \\(y_i = 1\\). Similarly, we have \\(S_S^2 = \\frac{n}{n-1}\\widehat{P}_S(1-\\widehat{P}_S)\\). Therefore, the HT estimator for population proportion under SRS is \\(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT} = \\overline{Y}_S = \\widehat{P}_S\\) and the estimated variance is obtained by plugging in the formula for \\(S_S^2\\) into Equation (2.16): \\[\\begin{equation} \\widehat{Var}(\\widehat{P}_S) = \\left(1-\\frac{n}{N}\\right)\\frac{\\widehat{P}_S(1-\\widehat{P}_S)}{n-1} \\tag{2.20} \\end{equation}\\] Example 2.16 Suppose we take an SRS of 30 students from a population of 100 students, and observe in our sample that \\(10\\%\\) of students have private washroom. Then we can use \\(\\widehat{P}_S = 10\\% = 0.1\\) to estimate the proportion of students in the population that have private washroom. The estimated variance of this estimate is \\[ \\widehat{Var}(\\widehat{P}_S) = \\left(1-\\frac{30}{100}\\right)\\frac{0.1\\times(1-0.1)}{30-1} = 0.0022 \\] and the standard error is \\(\\sqrt{0.0022} = 0.0469\\). 2.8 Confidence Intervals A \\(100(1-\\alpha)\\%\\) confidence interval is defined as an interval \\((LB_S, UB_S)\\) which satisfies \\[\\begin{equation} \\P(LB_S \\le \\theta \\le UB_S) = 1-\\alpha. \\tag{2.21} \\end{equation}\\] To construct confidence intervals for HT estimators, we use the Central Limit Theorem for HT estimators Berger (1998): \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\widehat{\\theta}_{HT} - \\theta}{SE(\\widehat{\\theta}_{HT})} \\to \\mathcal{N}(0,1). \\tag{2.22} \\end{equation}\\] This is called the asymptotic normality of the HT estimators. The asymptotic here means that if the population size \\(N\\) goes to infinity, the sample size \\(n\\) also goes to infinity, and \\(N-n\\) goes to infinity, then \\((\\widehat{\\theta}_{HT} - \\theta)/SE(\\widehat{\\theta}_{HT})\\) will follows a standard normal distribution. In practice, if \\(y\\) roughly follows normal distribution, then with \\(n \\ge 30\\) and \\(N &gt;&gt; n\\), we can apply the central limit theorem (Lohr 2021). Based on the Central Limit Theorem, we have \\[\\begin{equation} \\P\\left(\\left|\\frac{\\widehat{\\theta}_{HT}-\\theta}{SE(\\widehat{\\theta}_{HT})}\\right| \\le z_{\\alpha/2}\\right) = 1-\\alpha, \\tag{2.23} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(z_{\\alpha/2}\\) is the \\(1-\\alpha/2\\) quantile of the standard normal distribution. This is the same as \\[ \\P\\Big(\\widehat{\\theta}_{HT} - z_{\\alpha/2}SE(\\widehat{\\theta}_{HT}) \\le \\theta \\le \\widehat{\\theta}_{HT} + z_{\\alpha/2}SE(\\widehat{\\theta}_{HT})\\Big) = 1-\\alpha. \\] Compare this to Equation (2.21), we see that, in our case, \\[ LB_S = \\widehat{\\theta}_{HT} - z_{\\alpha/2}SE(\\widehat{\\theta}_{HT}) \\hspace{5mm} \\text{and} \\hspace{5mm} UB_S = \\widehat{\\theta}_{HT} + z_{\\alpha/2}SE(\\widehat{\\theta}_{HT}) \\] and the confidence interval is \\[ \\widehat{\\theta}_{HT} \\pm z_{\\alpha/2}SE(\\widehat{\\theta}_{HT}) = (\\widehat{\\theta}_{HT} - z_{\\alpha/2}SE(\\widehat{\\theta}_{HT}), \\widehat{\\theta}_{HT} + z_{\\alpha/2}SE(\\widehat{\\theta}_{HT})) \\] Usually, we use \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) to obtain \\(95\\%\\) CI and thus \\(z_{\\alpha/2} = 1.96\\). We can see that \\(LB_S\\) and \\(UB_S\\) are calculated from the sample, which is why I used the subscript \\(S\\) in the notation. Therefore, if we repeat the sample selection process, we will receive a different confidence interval. Furthermore, if we repeat the sample selection process many times, then \\(100(1-\\alpha)\\%\\) of the obtained confidence intervals will contain the true value. See Figure 2.3 for an illustration. In general, we say for short that we are \\(100(1 − \\alpha)\\%\\) confident that \\(\\theta\\) lies in the interval. Figure 2.3: Visual illustration of confidence intervals. The red dotted line represents the true value8. In R, we can obtain the confidence interval by using the code: est.total &lt;- svytotal(x = ~y, design = design.srs) confint(est.total) and est.mean &lt;- svymean(x = ~y, design = design.srs) confint(est.mean) Example 2.17 In Example 2.14, the \\(95\\%\\) confidence interval is \\[ \\frac{21}{4} \\pm 1.96 \\times 1.3919 = (2.5219, 7.9781). \\] In R, we can write est.mean &lt;- svymean(x = ~y, design = design.srs) confint(est.mean) ## 2.5 % 97.5 % ## y 2.521846 7.978154 In Example 2.16, the \\(95\\%\\) confidence interval is \\[ 0.1 \\pm 1.96 \\times 0.0469 = (0.0081, 0.1919). \\] 2.9 Sample Size Determination In Sections 2.6, we see that, in order to perform SRS, we need to specify the sample size \\(n\\). In practice, sample size determination is useful for us to prepare for resources before we roll out our study and conduct the surveys to collect information/data. Usually, we have limited resources, so we will want a small sample size. Moreover, from Equation (2.14), as sample size \\(n\\) increases, the variance of \\(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT} = \\overline{Y}_S\\) decreases. So in this case, we want the sample size to be big so that our estimates are more precise. To reconcile these two objectives, usually sample sizes are determined based on the following statement: we want a sample size \\(n\\) so that \\[\\begin{equation} \\P\\left(\\left|\\widehat{\\theta}-\\theta\\right| \\le e\\right) = 1-\\alpha, \\tag{2.24} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(e\\) is called the margin of error. This means that instead of surveying the whole population to get the exact population quantities like in a census, we want to survey a small sample while tolerating some errors \\(e\\) with confidence \\(1-\\alpha\\). From Equation (2.23), we can see that, in our survey sampling setting with HT estimators, \\[\\begin{equation} e = z_{\\alpha/2}SE(\\widehat{\\theta}), \\tag{2.25} \\end{equation}\\] Since \\(SE(\\widehat{\\theta}_{HT})\\) is related to \\(n\\), we can solve Equation (2.25) to obtain the desired sample size \\(n\\). Note that \\(n\\) is an integer, if a non-integer number is obtained while solving Equation (2.25), we then round up the number to get the desired sample size (we better sample more). Now, if our HT estimator of interest is \\(\\overline{Y}_S\\), then \\[ e = z_{\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{1-\\frac{n}{N}}\\frac{s_U}{\\sqrt{n}} \\] Solving the above equation, we obtain \\[\\begin{equation} n = \\frac{z_{\\alpha/2}^2s_U^2}{e^2 + \\frac{z_{\\alpha/2}^2s_U^2}{N}} \\tag{2.26} \\end{equation}\\] Proof. \\[\\begin{align*} &amp; e = z_{\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{1-\\frac{n}{N}}\\frac{s_U}{\\sqrt{n}} \\\\ &amp; \\Leftrightarrow e^2 = z_{\\alpha/2}^2\\left(1-\\frac{n}{N}\\right)\\frac{s_U^2}{n} \\\\ &amp; \\Leftrightarrow \\frac{e^2}{z_{\\alpha/2}^2s_U^2} = \\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{1}{N} \\\\ &amp; \\Leftrightarrow n = \\frac{1}{\\frac{e^2}{z_{\\alpha/2}^2s_U^2} + \\frac{1}{N}} \\\\ &amp; \\Leftrightarrow n = \\frac{z_{\\alpha/2}^2s_U^2}{e^2 + \\frac{z_{\\alpha/2}^2s_U^2}{N}} \\end{align*}\\] Example 2.18 We are conducting an SRS from a population of \\(N = 1251\\) students to estimate the mean rent. If the population standard deviation is \\(\\$300\\), we can tolerate an error of \\(\\$100\\) with \\(95\\%\\) confidence. Then the sample size we need is \\[ n = \\frac{1.96^2\\times 300^2}{100^2 + \\frac{1.96^2\\times 300^2}{1251}} = 33.6446 \\] So the sample size we need is 34 students. In general, we do not know \\(s_U^2\\) and cannot estimate it before we conduct the survey. We may guess its value based on a pilot study, a previous study in the literature, or from an educated guess from the domain expert. However, when what we are interested in is the proportion, from algebra, we know that for \\(0 \\le p_U \\le 1\\), \\(p_U(1-p_U) = \\frac{1}{4} - (x-\\frac{1}{2})^2 \\le \\frac{1}{4}\\). We can use this to estimate the largest value of \\(s_U^2\\): \\[ s_U^2 = \\frac{N}{N-1}p_U(1-p_U) \\approx p_U(1-p_U) \\le \\frac{1}{4}. \\] Here, the approximation happens when \\(N\\) is large. Now, we can use this maximum value of \\(s_U^2\\) to plug in Equation (2.26) to get a conservative sample size, i.e., a sample size that is possibly larger than needed, but we’re better safe than sorry. Example 2.19 Suppose we want to estimate the proportion of students who have private washroom. We plan to take an SRS from a population of \\(N=1251\\) students, and want to use \\(95\\%\\) with margin or error \\(0.03\\). The sample size we need is \\[ n = \\frac{1.96^2\\times \\frac{1}{4}}{0.03^2 + \\frac{1.96^2\\times \\frac{1}{4}}{1251}} = 575.8809 \\to 576. \\] In Example 2.18, we see that \\(s_U\\) has unit of Canadian dollar. In that case, for different study we need to specify a specific value of \\(s_U\\) depending on the unit of the response variable \\(Y\\). Instead, we may know the relative ratio between the standard deviation and the mean, for example, from a study about student rent in the US where the data is collected in US dollar. Now, the ratio \\(CV = s_U/\\overline{y}_U\\), which is called the coefficient of variation, can help us! This is because the coefficient of variation does not have a unit, i.e., it is scale-free. Specifically, we can make a statement like this: we want a sample size \\(n\\) so that \\[\\begin{equation} \\P\\left(\\left|\\frac{\\widehat{\\theta}-\\theta}{\\theta}\\right| \\le r\\right) = 1-\\alpha, \\tag{2.27} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(r\\) is called the relative precision. In case of wanting to estimate the population mean under SRS, we can determine, in the similar fashion as in Equation (2.26), that \\[ n = \\frac{z_{\\alpha/2}^2(s_U/\\overline{y}_U)^2}{r^2 + \\frac{z_{\\alpha/2}^2(s_U/\\overline{y}_U)^2}{N}}, \\] where \\(s_U/\\overline{y}_U\\) is the coefficient of variation! Example 2.20 Suppose we want to estimate the mean rent payments of students. We plan to take an SRS from a population of \\(N=1251\\) students, and want to use \\(95\\%\\) with relative precision \\(0.3\\). The population coefficient of variation is estimated to be \\(0.8\\). The sample size needed is: \\[ n = \\frac{1.96^2\\times 0.8^2}{0.3^2 + \\frac{1.96^2\\times 0.8^2}{1251}} = 26.7343 \\to 27. \\] There are other frameworks, such as the model-based framework, but it will not be the focus of this book.↩︎ Here, independent means tossing a coin so that the result of one toss does not depend on the result of another toss.↩︎ Recall that we often do not have time and budget to interview everyone!↩︎ Note that this does not have any relationship with the Poisson distribution.↩︎ If you are not familiar with combination, check it here↩︎ Remember that a distribution is formed from repeating a probabilistic experiment infinite number of times.

The strata: (i) do not overlap and (ii) constitute the whole population, such that each sampling unit belongs to exactly one stratum9. Sampling: Draw an independent probability sample from each stratum. Recall from Section 2.4 that a probability sample is when we know the sampling or inclusion probability for each unit in the population. If we draw a non-probability sample in each stratum, that is called quota sampling instead of startified sampling. In this chapter, we consider taking independent Simple Random Sampling (SRS) sample from each stratum. Check Section 2.6 for a refresh on SRS. Figure 3.1 illustrates stratified sampling, where the population is divided into strata of different colors, and from each of the stratum, some units are selected randomly and added into the sample. Figure 3.1: Visual illustration of stratified sampling technique. Example 3.1 In the students’ rent Example 1.1, we can divide the students at USask by their college affiliation such that each student is only affiliated to one college. Stratified sampling is when we independently take an SRS from each of the colleges. Now, college affiliation is the stratification variable. 3.1.2 Why Stratification? Stratification is usually used because It is more convenient to administer the survey and may lower costs Imagine having to get an email list of all students at the university, versus asking each college their student email list. Sometimes we want inference for subgroups Instead of only wanting to know the mean rent payment of all students at the university, we may also want to know the mean rent payment of students from each college specifically. Improve representativeness of the sample If we take an SRS from the whole university, we may end up with a sample without any student from Arts and Science. However, with stratified sampling, our sample will contain students from all colleges at USask. As we will see in later sections, stratified sampling usually gives more precise (i.e., lower variance) estimates for population means and totals. 3.2 Estimation 3.2.1 Population Parameters Suppose we divide the population \\(U\\) of \\(N\\) units into \\(H\\) strata: \\(U_1, U_2, ..., U_H\\). Note that, by definition in Section 3.1.1: These strata do not overlap, i.e., \\(U_h \\cap U_l = \\emptyset\\) for \\(1 \\le h \\ne l \\le H\\). These strata comprise the full population, i.e., \\(U = U_1 \\cup U_2 \\cup ... \\cup U_H\\). Suppose the \\(h\\)th stratum \\(U_h\\) contains \\(N_h\\) units, then \\(\\sum_{h=1}^H N_h = N\\). Let \\(y_{h,i}\\) denote the response of the \\(i\\)th unit in the \\(h\\)th stratum. We then have the population and subpopulation parameters as follows: Stratum (subpopulation) \\(h\\) Population Total \\(\\color{red}{t_{U,h} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_h}y_{h,i}}\\) \\(\\color{red}{t_U = \\sum_{h=1}^H t_{U,h}} = \\sum_{h=1}^H\\sum_{i=1}^{N_h}y_{h,i}\\) Mean \\(\\color{red}{\\overline{y}_{U,h} = \\frac{1}{N_h}t_{U,h}} = \\frac{1}{N_h} \\sum_{i=1}^{N_h}y_{h,i}\\) \\(\\color{red}{\\overline{y}_U = \\frac{1}{N}t_U} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{h=1}^H\\sum_{i=1}^{N_h}y_{h,i}\\) Variance \\(\\color{red}{s_{U,h}^2} = \\frac{1}{N_h-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{N_h}(y_{h,i}-\\overline{y}_{U,h})^2\\) \\(\\color{red}{s_U^2} = \\frac{1}{N-1}\\sum_{h=1}^H\\sum_{i=1}^{N_h}(y_{h,i}-\\overline{y}_U)^2\\) Notes: We cannot average the subpopulation means to get the overall population mean, i.e., \\(\\overline{y}_U \\ne \\frac{1}{H}\\overline{y}_{U,h}\\). This is because \\(\\overline{y}_{U,h}\\) is the mean that represents \\(N_h\\) units in the population. Therefore, we have to use a weighted average instead, with each \\(\\overline{y}_{U,h}\\) weighted by the fraction of number of units in stratum \\(h\\) out of the whole population, i.e., \\(N_h/N\\). \\[ \\overline{y}_U = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{h=1}^H\\sum_{i=1}^{N_h}y_{h,i}=\\sum_{h=1}^H\\frac{N_h}{N}\\overline{y}_{U,h} \\] 3.2.2 Sample and HT Estimators As defined in Section 3.1.1, for each \\(h\\), we take an SRS sample \\(S_h\\) of \\(n_h\\) units from stratum \\(U_h\\). Then our overall sample consists of units from these subsets: \\(S = S_1 \\cup S_2 \\cup ... \\cup S_H\\) and the overall sample size is \\(n = \\sum_{h=1}^H n_h\\). Since we take an SRS from each of the stratum, we can use the HT estimators in Section 2.5.2 to estimate the subpopulation means and totals. By aggregating these subpopulation HT estimators, we can get the HT estimators for the population mean and total. The order is: First, calculate the HT estimates for the subpopulation means \\(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT,h}\\). Since subpopulations are sampled using SRS, HT estimates for subpopulation means are the sample means, i.e., \\(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT,h} = \\overline{Y}_{S,h}\\) Now, calculate the HT estimates for the subpopulation totals \\(\\widehat{T}_{HT,h}\\), which equals the estimates of the subpopulation means times the number of units in the subpopulation: \\(\\widehat{T}_{HT,h} = N_h\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT,h}\\). Then, calculate the HT estimate for the overall population total \\(\\widehat{T}_{HT}\\) by summing the HT estimates of the subpopulation totals: \\(\\widehat{T}_{HT} = \\sum_{h=1}^H \\widehat{T}_{HT,h}\\). Finally, calculate the HT estimate for the overall population mean \\(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT}\\) by dividing the HT estimate for the overall population total by the number of units in the population: \\(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT} = \\frac{1}{N}\\widehat{T}_{HT}\\). The process is summarized in the table below: HT estimators for stratum \\(h\\) HT estimators for whole population Mean \\(\\color{red}{\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT,h} = \\overline{Y}_{S,h}} = \\frac{1}{n_h} \\sum_{i \\in S_h}y_{h,i}\\) \\(\\color{red}{\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT} = \\frac{1}{N}\\widehat{T}_{HT}} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{h=1}^H\\sum_{i=1}^{N_h}y_{h,i}\\) Total \\(\\color{red}{\\widehat{T}_{HT,h} = N_h\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT,h}} = \\frac{N_h}{n_h} \\sum_{i \\in S_h}y_{h,i}\\) \\(\\color{red}{\\widehat{T}_{HT} = \\sum_{h=1}^H \\widehat{T}_{HT,h}} = \\sum_{h=1}^H N_h\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT,h}\\) Notes: Here, the HT estimator for the overall population mean is not equal to the overall sample mean, i.e., \\(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT} \\ne \\overline{Y}_S\\). This is the result for SRS only. Here, we are dealing with stratified sampling, not SRS. 3.2.3 Variances In stratified sampling, SRS samples are taken independently from each stratum. Therefore, we can derive that \\[\\begin{equation} Var_{strt}\\left(\\widehat{T}_{HT}\\right) = \\sum_{h=1}^H Var_{SRS}(\\widehat{T}_{HT,h}) = \\sum_{h=1}^H N_h^2\\left(1-\\frac{n_h}{N_h}\\right)\\frac{s^2_{U,h}}{n_h}. \\tag{3.1} \\end{equation}\\] Proof. Recall in Section 2.7.2, we derived the variance of a general HT estimator as \\[ Var(\\widehat{T}_{HT}) = \\sum_{i=1}^N\\frac{y_i^2}{\\pi_i^2}Var(Z_i) + 2\\sum_{i\\ne j}\\frac{y_iy_j}{\\pi_i\\pi_j}Cov(Z_i, Z_j) \\] We can apply this to stratified sampling and derive \\[\\begin{align*} Var_{strt}(\\widehat{T}_{HT}) &amp; = \\sum_{i=1}^N\\frac{y_i^2}{\\pi_i^2}Var(Z_i) + 2\\sum_{i\\ne j}\\frac{y_iy_j}{\\pi_i\\pi_j}Cov(Z_i, Z_j) \\\\ &amp; = \\sum_{h=1}^H\\sum_{i=1}^{N_h}\\frac{y_{h,i}^2}{\\pi_{h,i}^2}Var(Z_{h,i}) + 2\\sum_{h=1}^H\\sum_{i\\ne j, i \\in U_h, j \\in U_h}\\frac{y_{h,i}y_{h,j}}{\\pi_{h,i}\\pi_{h,j}}Cov(Z_{h,i}, Z_{h,j}) \\\\ &amp; \\qquad + 2\\sum_{h=1}^H\\sum_{i \\in U_h, j \\in U_l, h\\ne l}\\frac{y_{h,i}y_{l,j}}{\\pi_{h,i}\\pi_{l,j}}Cov(Z_{h,i}, Z_{l,j}) \\\\ &amp; = \\sum_{h=1}^H\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N_h}\\frac{y_{h,i}^2}{\\pi_{h,i}^2}Var(Z_{h,i}) + 2\\sum_{i\\ne j, i \\in U_h, j \\in U_h}\\frac{y_{h,i}y_{h,j}}{\\pi_{h,i}\\pi_{h,j}}Cov(Z_{h,i}, Z_{h,j})\\right) \\\\ &amp; = \\sum_{h=1}^H Var_{SRS}(\\widehat{T}_{HT,h}) \\end{align*}\\] In the second equation, I first divide the population into subpopulations \\(U_h\\), \\(h=1, 2, ..., H\\). I then divide all pairs \\(i,j\\) into two categories: (i) units \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) are in the same stratum or (ii) they are in different strata. In the third equation, since SRS are taken independently from each stratum, if units \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) are from different strata, then \\(Cov(Z_{h,i}, Z_{l,j}) = 0\\). Finally, the last equation happens because SRS samples are taken from each stratum. Similarly, since \\(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT} = \\frac{1}{N}\\widehat{T}_{HT}\\), we have \\(Var\\left(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT}\\right) = \\frac{1}{N^2}Var\\left(\\widehat{T}_{HT}\\right)\\), and therefore: \\[\\begin{equation} Var_{strt}\\left(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT}\\right) = \\sum_{h=1}^H Var_{SRS}(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT,h}) = \\sum_{h=1}^H \\left(1-\\frac{n_h}{N_h}\\right)\\frac{s^2_{U,h}}{n_h}. \\tag{3.2} \\end{equation}\\] 3.2.4 Variance Estimators From Equations (3.1) and (3.2) and the fact that each subpopulation are sampled using SRS, we can use the SRS variance estimators for each subpopulation and sum them together to get the variance estimators for the population, that is: \\[\\begin{equation} \\widehat{Var}_{strt}\\left(\\widehat{T}_{HT}\\right) = \\sum_{h=1}^H \\widehat{Var}_{SRS}(\\widehat{T}_{HT,h}) = \\sum_{h=1}^H N_h^2\\left(1-\\frac{n_h}{N_h}\\right)\\frac{S^2_{S,h}}{n_h}, \\tag{3.3} \\end{equation}\\] and \\[\\begin{equation} \\widehat{Var}_{strt}\\left(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT}\\right) = \\sum_{h=1}^H \\widehat{Var}_{SRS}(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT,h}) = \\sum_{h=1}^H \\left(1-\\frac{n_h}{N_h}\\right)\\frac{S^2_{S,h}}{n_h}. \\tag{3.4} \\end{equation}\\] In other words, in Equations (3.1) and (3.2), we replace the subpopulation variances \\(s^2_{U,h}\\) by the sub-sample variances \\(S^2_{S,h}\\). Example 3.2 Suppose we conducted stratified sampling and collected the following information: Stratum \\(N_h\\) \\(n_h\\) \\(\\overline{Y}_{S,h}\\) \\(S_{S,h}^2\\) \\(\\widehat{T}_{HT,h}\\) \\(\\widehat{Var}_{SRS}(\\widehat{T}_{HT,h})\\) \\(A\\) \\(100\\) \\(20\\) \\(7\\) \\(2\\) \\(100 \\times 7 = 700\\) \\(100^2\\times \\left(1-\\frac{20}{100}\\right)\\times \\frac{2}{20} = 800\\) \\(B\\) \\(200\\) \\(40\\) \\(4\\) \\(4\\) \\(200 \\times 4 = 800\\) \\(200^2\\times \\left(1-\\frac{40}{200}\\right)\\times \\frac{4}{40} = 3200\\) \\(C\\) \\(300\\) \\(50\\) \\(6\\) \\(3\\) \\(300 \\times 6 = 1800\\) \\(300^2\\times \\left(1-\\frac{50}{300}\\right)\\times \\frac{3}{50} = 4500\\) To estimate the overall population total, we have \\(\\widehat{T}_{HT} = \\widehat{T}_{HT, A} + \\widehat{T}_{HT, B} + \\widehat{T}_{HT, C} = 700 + 800 + 1800 = 3300\\) \\(\\widehat{Var}(\\widehat{T}_{HT}) = \\widehat{Var}(\\widehat{T}_{HT, A}) + \\widehat{Var}(\\widehat{T}_{HT, B}) + \\widehat{Var}(\\widehat{T}_{HT, C}) = 8500\\) 95% CI: \\(3300 \\pm 1.96 \\times \\sqrt{8500} = (3119.297, 3480.703)\\) To estimate the overall population mean, we have \\(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT} = \\frac{1}{N}\\widehat{T}_{HT} = \\frac{3300}{600} = 5.5\\). \\(\\widehat{Var}(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT}) = \\frac{1}{N^2}\\widehat{Var}(\\widehat{T}_{HT}) = \\frac{8500}{600^2} = 0.0236\\) 95% CI: \\(5.5 \\pm 1.96 \\times \\sqrt{0.0236} = (5.1989, 5.8011)\\) 3.3 Design 3.3.1 Approaches In Chapter 2, we considered two sampling schemes, Poisson sampling and SRS. To designa Poisson sampling, we only need to specify only one design feature, which is the expected sample size \\(n^*\\). Similarly, for SRS, we only need to specify the sample size \\(n\\). In stratified sampling, we need to consider two design features, that is, we need to: define the stratification variable, and determine the sample size \\(n_h\\) in each stratum \\(h = 1,2, ..., H\\). There are two approaches to the design of stratified sampling. First approach: Suppose we want precise estimates \\(\\widehat{T}_{HT,h}\\) or \\(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT,h}\\) for each stratum \\(h\\). In this case, the stratification variable is already well-defined from our research interest we only need to determine a tolerable margin of error \\(e_h\\) for each stratum \\(h\\), then proceed to separately calculate sample size \\(n_h\\) for each stratum \\(h\\) just like in SRS (see Section 2.9). Second approach: For a fixed general sample size \\(n\\), determine an allocation rule for \\(n_h\\) such that \\[ n = n_1 + n_2 + ... + n_H. \\] Based on the allocation rule, we Derive the formula of \\(Var_{strt}(\\widehat{T}_{HT,h})\\) or \\(Var_{strt}(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT,h})\\) so that the formula is related to \\(n\\). Solve for \\(n\\) based on the formula and the tolerable margin of error \\(e\\). Determine \\(n_h\\) for each \\(h = 1, 2, ..., H\\) from the allocation rule. We will explore more about the second approach in the following sections. 3.3.2 Proportional Allocation 3.3.2.1 Definition and Properties Proportional allocation is when we sample proportional to the size of the stratum, that is \\[\\begin{equation} n_h \\propto N_h. \\tag{3.5} \\end{equation}\\] This means that there is a constant \\(k\\), which is not dependent on \\(h\\), such that \\(n_h = kN_h\\) for all \\(h = 1, 2, ..., H\\). However, we also know that \\(\\sum_{h=1}^Hn_h = n\\). This implies \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{n}{N} = \\frac{n_1}{N_1} = \\frac{n_2}{N_2} = ... = \\frac{n_H}{N_H}. \\tag{3.6} \\end{equation}\\] Proof. We have \\[\\begin{align*} n &amp; = \\sum_{h=1}^Hn_h \\\\ &amp; = \\sum_{h=1}^H kN_h \\\\ &amp; = k \\sum_{h=1}^H N_h \\\\ &amp; = k N \\end{align*}\\] Therefore, \\(k = \\frac{n}{N}\\) and thus \\(n_h = \\frac{n}{N}N_h\\) and \\(\\frac{n_h}{N_h} = \\frac{n}{N}\\) for all \\(h = 1, 2, ..., H\\). With proportional allocation, the sample is a miniature version of the population, and thus, the sample is representative of the population in terms of the stratification variable. An illustration of proportional allocation is given in Figure 3.2, where we take a sample of \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) the size of the population. The sample comprises of sub-samples that are \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) the size of each stratum. The resulting sample is representative of the population in terms of color: one half of the sample is orange, one fourth is blue and the other one fourth is green. Figure 3.2: Visual illustration of proportional allocation. Example 3.3 Consider sampling from a population of \\(N_1=2400\\) men and \\(N_2=1600\\) women. If we take a \\(10\\%\\) stratified sample with proportional allocation, our sample will have \\(n_1 = N_1 \\times 10\\% = 240\\) men and \\(n_2 = N_2 \\times 10\\% = 160\\) women. The sample now has the same proportions of men and women as the population. Another property of stratified sampling with proportional allocation is that it is self-weighting: the probability that the \\(i\\)th unit from stratum \\(h\\) is included in our sample is \\(\\pi_{h,i} = \\frac{n_h}{N_h} = \\frac{n}{N}\\), since we do SRS within each stratum. Therefore, the weight for the \\(i\\)th unit from stratum \\(h\\) is \\(w_{h,i} = \\frac{1}{\\pi_{h,i}} = \\frac{N}{n}\\), which is the same across all units and strata. We also have that \\[ \\widehat{T}_{HT} = \\sum_{h=1}^H \\widehat{T}_{HT,h} = \\sum_{h=1}^H\\sum_{i\\in S_h}\\frac{N_h}{n_h}y_{h,i} = \\sum_{h=1}^H\\sum_{i\\in S_h}\\frac{N}{n}y_{h,i} \\] In other words, each unit in the sample \\(S = S_1 \\cup ...\\cup S_h\\) represents the same number of units, i. \\(\\frac{N}{n}\\), in the population. Example 3.4 Continuing with Example 3.3, each unit in our sample will represent \\(\\frac{1}{10\\%}= 10\\) people in the population. 3.3.2.2 Variances Plugging \\(\\frac{n_h}{N_h} = \\frac{n}{N}\\) into Equation (3.1), we get \\[\\begin{equation} Var_{strt,prop}\\left(\\widehat{T}_{HT}\\right) = \\frac{N}{n}\\left(1-\\frac{n}{N}\\right)\\sum_{h=1}^HN_hs_{U,h}^2. \\tag{3.7} \\end{equation}\\] Proof. We have \\[\\begin{align*} Var_{strt,prop}(\\widehat{T}_{HT}) &amp; = \\sum_{h=1}^H Var_{SRS}(\\widehat{T}_{HT,h}) \\\\ &amp; = \\sum_{h=1}^H N_h^2\\left(1-\\frac{n_h}{N_h}\\right)\\frac{s_{U,h}^2}{n_h} \\\\ &amp; = \\sum_{h=1}^H N_h \\frac{N_h}{n_h}\\left(1-\\frac{n_h}{N_h}\\right)s_{U,h}^2 \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{N}{n}\\left(1-\\frac{n}{N}\\right)\\sum_{h=1}^HN_hs_{U,h}^2. \\end{align*}\\] Similarly, \\[\\begin{equation} Var_{strt,prop}\\left(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT}\\right) = \\frac{1}{nN}\\left(1-\\frac{n}{N}\\right)\\sum_{h=1}^HN_hs_{U,h}^2. \\tag{3.8} \\end{equation}\\] 3.3.2.3 Comparing to SRS In this section, we explore whether stratification is worthwhile, or whether we have better use SRS, in terms of estimating the population total (or mean). Note that in both cases, we are using the Horvitz-Thompson estimator, so we are unbiased. We only need to compare the variance then. Recall from Equation (2.13) that the variance of the Horvitz-Thompson estimator for the population total under SRS is \\[\\begin{equation} Var_{SRS}\\left(\\widehat{T}_{HT}\\right) = N^2\\left(1-\\frac{n}{N}\\right)\\frac{s_U^2}{n} = \\frac{N}{n}\\left(1-\\frac{n}{N}\\right)Ns_U^2 \\tag{3.9} \\end{equation}\\] On the other hand, from Equation (3.7), the variance of the Horvitz-Thompson estimator for the population total under stratified sampling with proportional allocation is: \\[\\begin{equation} Var_{strt,prop}\\left(\\widehat{T}_{HT}\\right) = \\frac{N}{n}\\left(1-\\frac{n}{N}\\right)\\sum_{h=1}^HN_hs_{U,h}^2. \\tag{3.10} \\end{equation}\\] Therefore, to compare \\(Var_{SRS}\\left(\\widehat{T}_{HT}\\right)\\) and \\(Var_{strt,prop}\\left(\\widehat{T}_{HT}\\right)\\), we need to compare \\(Ns_U^2\\) and \\(\\sum_{h=1}^HN_hs_{U,h}^2\\). To make this comparison easier, we define Sum of Squares Notation Formula Meaning Between \\(SSB\\) \\(\\sum_{h=1}^HN_h(\\overline{y}_{U,h} - \\overline{y}_U)^2\\) Between-strata variation Within \\(SSW\\) \\(\\sum_{h=1}^H\\sum_{i=1}^{N_h}(y_{h,i}-\\overline{y}_{U,h})^2\\) Within-stratum variation Total \\(SST\\) \\(\\sum_{h=1}^H\\sum_{i=1}^{N_h}(y_{h,i}-\\overline{y}_U)^2\\) Total variation The within-stratum variation measures the differences of units to its respective means, the between-strata variation measures the differences of the stratum means to the overall means, and the total variation measures the differences of units to the overall means. Example 3.5 For example, the within-stratum variation sums over the differences such as of an Arts and Science student’s monthly rent payment to the Arts and Science mean, the between-stratum variation sums over the differences such as of the Arts and Science mean to the USask mean, and the total variation sums over the differences such as of a student to the USask mean. We can prove that \\(SST = SSW + SSB\\). Proof. We have \\[\\begin{align*} SST &amp; = \\sum_{h=1}^H\\sum_{i=1}^{N_h}(y_{h,i}-\\overline{y}_U)^2 \\\\ &amp; = \\sum_{h=1}^H\\sum_{i=1}^{N_h}\\left([y_{h,i}- \\overline{y}_{U,h}] - [\\overline{y}_U - \\overline{y}_{U,h}] \\right)^2 \\\\ &amp; = \\sum_{h=1}^H\\sum_{i=1}^{N_h}(y_{h,i}- \\overline{y}_{U,h})^2 + \\sum_{h=1}^H\\sum_{i=1}^{N_h}(\\overline{y}_U - \\overline{y}_{U,h})^2 - 2\\sum_{h=1}^H\\sum_{i=1}^{N_h}(y_{h,i}- \\overline{y}_{U,h})(\\overline{y}_U - \\overline{y}_{U,h}) \\\\ &amp; = \\sum_{h=1}^H\\sum_{i=1}^{N_h}(y_{h,i}- \\overline{y}_{U,h})^2 + \\sum_{h=1}^HN_h(\\overline{y}_U - \\overline{y}_{U,h})^2 - 2\\sum_{h=1}^H(\\overline{y}_U - \\overline{y}_{U,h})\\sum_{i=1}^{N_h}(y_{h,i}- \\overline{y}_{U,h}) \\\\ &amp; = \\sum_{h=1}^H\\sum_{i=1}^{N_h}(y_{h,i}- \\overline{y}_{U,h})^2 + \\sum_{h=1}^HN_h(\\overline{y}_{U,h} - \\overline{y}_U)^2 - 2\\sum_{h=1}^H(\\overline{y}_U - \\overline{y}_{U,h})\\left[\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N_h}y_{h,i}\\right) - \\left(N_h\\overline{y}_{U,h}\\right) \\right] \\\\ &amp; = SSW + SSB - 2\\sum_{h=1}^H(\\overline{y}_U - \\overline{y}_{U,h})\\left[t_{U,h} - t_{U,h}\\right) \\right] \\\\ &amp; = SSW + SSB - 0 \\\\ &amp; = SSW + SSB \\end{align*}\\] Using the definitions of \\(SST, SSB\\) and \\(SSW\\), we have \\[ Ns_U^2 = \\frac{N}{N-1}\\sum_{h=1}^H\\sum_{i=1}^{N_h}(y_{h,i}-\\overline{y}_U)^2 = \\frac{N}{N-1}SST = \\frac{N}{N-1}(SSW + SSB) \\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\sum_{h=1}^H N_hs_{U,h}^2 &amp; = \\sum_{h=1}^H\\frac{N_h}{N_h-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{N_h}(y_{h,i}-\\overline{y}_{U,h})^2 = \\sum_{h=1}^H\\left(1+\\frac{1}{N_h-1}\\right)\\sum_{i=1}^{N_h}(y_{h,i}-\\overline{y}_{U,h})^2 \\\\ &amp; = SSW + \\sum_{h=1}^H s_{U,h}^2 \\end{align*}\\] Plugging these into the formula of (3.9) and (3.10) we have \\[\\begin{equation} Var_{SRS}\\left(\\widehat{T}_{HT}\\right) - Var_{strt,prop}\\left(\\widehat{T}_{HT}\\right) = \\frac{N}{n}\\left(1-\\frac{n}{N}\\right) \\frac{N}{N-1} \\left[ SSB - \\sum_{h=1}^H \\left(1-\\frac{N_h}{N}\\right) s_{U,h}^2 \\right]. \\tag{3.11} \\end{equation}\\] Proof. \\[\\begin{align*} Var_{SRS}\\left(\\widehat{T}_{HT}\\right) - Var_{strt,prop}\\left(\\widehat{T}_{HT}\\right) &amp; = \\frac{N}{n}\\left(1-\\frac{n}{N}\\right) \\left[ \\frac{N}{N-1}(SSW + SSB) - \\left(SSW + \\sum_{h=1}^H s_{U,h}^2 \\right) \\right] \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{N}{n}\\left(1-\\frac{n}{N}\\right) \\left[ \\frac{N}{N-1}SSB + \\frac{1}{N-1}SSW - \\sum_{h=1}^H s_{U,h}^2 \\right] \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{N}{n}\\left(1-\\frac{n}{N}\\right) \\left[ \\frac{N}{N-1}SSB + \\frac{1}{N-1}SSW - \\sum_{h=1}^H s_{U,h}^2 \\right] \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{N}{n}\\left(1-\\frac{n}{N}\\right) \\left[ \\frac{N}{N-1}SSB + \\sum_{h=1}^H \\frac{N_h-1}{N-1} s_{U,h}^2 - \\sum_{h=1}^H s_{U,h}^2 \\right] \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{N}{n}\\left(1-\\frac{n}{N}\\right) \\left[ \\frac{N}{N-1}SSB - \\sum_{h=1}^H \\frac{N-N_h}{N-1} s_{U,h}^2 \\right] \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{N}{n}\\left(1-\\frac{n}{N}\\right) \\frac{N}{N-1} \\left[ SSB - \\sum_{h=1}^H \\left(1-\\frac{N_h}{N}\\right) s_{U,h}^2 \\right] \\\\ \\end{align*}\\] This is greater or equal to 0, that is, the variance from SRS is larger than the variance from stratification under proportional allocation, if \\[ SSB \\ge \\sum_{h=1}^H \\left(1-\\frac{N_h}{N}\\right) s_{U,h}^2 \\] This happens if \\(SSB\\) is large and \\(s^2_{U,h}\\) are small, for \\(h = 1, 2, ..., H\\). Therefore, to reduce variance using stratification, we should choose a stratification variable so that it is closely related with (i.e., predictive) of the variable of interest \\(Y\\) so that stratum means \\(\\overline{y}_{U,h}\\) are as different as possible, and unit responses \\(y_{h,i}\\) are similar within a stratum On another note, we also can prove that if \\(N_h\\) and \\(N\\) are large, then variance from stratified sampling under proportional allocation is always smalller than variance from SRS. In other words, we always gain efficiency (i.e., lower variance) with stratification and proporational allocation when strata sizes are large. Proof. When \\(N_h\\) and \\(N\\) are large, \\[ Ns^2_U = \\frac{N}{N-1}SST \\approx SST = SSB + SSW \\] and \\[ \\sum_{h=1}^H N_hs_{U,h}^2 = \\sum_{h=1}^H\\frac{N_h}{N_h-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{N_h}(y_{h,i}-\\overline{y}_{U,h})^2 \\approx \\sum_{h=1}^H\\sum_{i=1}^{N_h}(y_{h,i}-\\overline{y}_{U,h})^2 = SSW \\] Since \\(SSB\\) is a sum of squares, it is always positive. Therefore, \\(Ns^2_U \\ge \\sum_{h=1}^H N_hs_{U,h}^2\\), and thus \\(Var_{SRS}\\left(\\widehat{T}_{HT}\\right) \\ge Var_{strt,prop}\\left(\\widehat{T}_{HT}\\right)\\) and we always gain efficiency. Example 3.6 Since the number of students in each college is large, we are gaining efficiency when stratifying by college affiliation and do proportional allocation. In contrast, if the stratum sizes are small, stratum means \\(\\overline{y}_{U,h}\\) are similar, and within-stratum variation is large, we will lose efficiency by stratification. In that case, we prefer to use SRS. Example 3.7 Suppose we have two strata: Stratum \\(y_{h,i}\\) \\(\\overline{y}_{U,h}\\) \\(s_{U,h}^2\\) \\(1\\) \\(4,9,5\\) \\(\\frac{1}{3}(4+9+5) = 6\\) \\(\\frac{1}{3-1}\\left[(4-6)^2+(9-6)^2+(5-6)^2\\right] = 7\\) \\(2\\) \\(6,7,8\\) \\(\\frac{1}{3}(6+7+8) = 7\\) \\(\\frac{1}{3-1}\\left[(6-7)^2+(7-7)^2+(8-7)^2\\right] = 1\\) We can see that, in this case, \\(\\overline{y}_{U,1}\\) is very similar to \\(\\overline{y}_{U,2}\\). At the same time, \\(s_{U,1}^2\\) is large. We expect that stratification is hurting us. In fact, we have \\[ SSB = \\sum_{h=1}^H N_h(\\overline{y}_{U,h} - \\overline{y}_U)^2 = 3\\times (6-6.5)^2 + 3\\times (7-6.5)^2 = 1.5, \\] which is smaller than \\[ \\sum_{h=1}^H\\left(1-\\frac{N_h}{N}\\right)s_{U,h}^2 = \\left(1-\\frac{3}{6}\\right)\\times 7 + \\left(1-\\frac{3}{6}\\right)\\times 1 = 4. \\] Exercise 3.1 In Example 3.7, can you re-define two strata, each with 3 units, so that stratification with proportional allocation is better than SRS? 3.3.3 Optimal Allocation 3.3.3.1 Definition As discussed in Section 2.9, in survey sampling, we want to balance two contraries: (i) we want to have a large sample size so that the variance of our estimators are the smallest, on the other hand (ii) we only have limited time and resources to collect the survey information. Optimal allocation is a method in stratified sampling that explicitly minimizes the variance of the HT estimators within a fixed cost constraints. To formalize this mathematically, let \\(c_0\\) be the known overhead cost of the survey This can be the costs to start the survey such as administrative cost to apply for funding for the survey, to travel to or contact the survey hubs, etc. \\(c_h\\) be the known cost to sample one unit from stratum \\(h\\) This can be the cost to print the survey questionnaire, labor costs to interview individuals, etc. Suppose we have a fixed budget \\(C\\), then our unknown (or to-be-determined) sub-sample sizes \\(n_1, n_2, ..., n_H\\) must satisfy \\[ C = c_0 + \\sum_{h=1}^H c_hn_h, \\] while at the same time minimize10 \\[ Var_{strt}(\\widehat{T}_{HT}) = \\sum_{h=1}^H Var_{SRS}(\\widehat{T}_{HT,h}) = \\sum_{h=1}^H N_h^2 \\left(1-\\frac{n_h}{N_h}\\right)\\frac{s_{U,h}^2}{n_h}. \\] This is a constrained optimization problem where the objective is to minimize the variance subject to the budget constraint. We can prove that the solution \\(n_1, ..., n_H\\) for this problem satisfy \\[\\begin{equation} n_h \\propto \\frac{N_hs_{U,h}}{\\sqrt{c_h}} \\tag{3.12} \\end{equation}\\] Proof. We can solve this constraint optimization by using Lagrange multiplier. In particular, we form the function \\[ f(n_1, n_2, ..., n_H, \\lambda) = \\sum_{h=1}^H N_h^2 \\left(1-\\frac{n_h}{N_h}\\right)\\frac{s_{U,h}^2}{n_h} - \\lambda \\left(C - c_0 - \\sum_{h=1}^H c_hn_h\\right) \\] Take partial derivatives of \\(f\\) with respect to \\(n_h\\) and set them to 0 we get \\[ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial n_h} = -\\frac{N_h^2s_{U,h}^2}{n_h^2} + \\lambda c_h = 0 \\] This implies \\[ n_h = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\lambda}} \\frac{N_hs_{U,h}}{\\sqrt{c_n}} \\propto \\frac{N_hs_{U,h}}{\\sqrt{c_h}}. \\] From Equation (3.12), we can see that in optimal allocation, we will sample more in a stratum \\(h\\) if \\(c_h\\) is small, which means it is cheaper to sample there, and/or \\(N_h\\) is large, which means the stratum has a lot of units and we need to sample more there to lower our variance, and/or \\(s_{U,h}\\) is large, which means the responses vary a lot in that stratum and we need to sample more there to lower our variance. Using the same argument as in Equation (3.6), we have \\[ n_h = \\left(\\frac{\\frac{N_hs_{U,h}}{\\sqrt{c_h}}}{\\sum_{l=1}^H \\frac{N_ls_{U,l}}{\\sqrt{c_l}}}\\right)n. \\] 3.3.3.2 Neyman Allocation A special case of optimal allocation is Neyman allocation. When the costs to sample one unit from each stratum are the same, that is, \\(c_1 = c_2 = ... = c_H\\), then optimal allocation becomes Neyman allocation, where \\[\\begin{equation} n_h \\propto N_hs_{U,h} \\tag{3.13} \\end{equation}\\] Under stratified sampling with Neyman allocation, the variance of the HT estimator for the population mean is \\[\\begin{equation} Var_{strt,Ney}(\\widehat{T}_{HT}) = \\frac{1}{n}\\left(\\sum_{h=1}^H N_hs_{U,h}\\right)^2 - \\sum_{h=1}^H N_hs_{U,h}^2. \\tag{3.14} \\end{equation}\\] Proof. Neyman allocation implies \\[ n_h = \\left(\\frac{N_hs_{U,h}}{\\sum_{l=1}^H N_ls_{U,l}}\\right)n \\] Pluggin this into the variance formula for the HT estimator of the population total under stratified sampling, we have \\[\\begin{align*} Var_{strt}(\\widehat{T}_{HT}) &amp; = \\sum_{h=1}^H Var_{SRS}(\\widehat{T}_{HT,h}) = \\sum_{h=1}^H N_h^2 \\left(1-\\frac{n_h}{N_h}\\right)\\frac{s_{U,h}^2}{n_h} \\\\ &amp; = \\sum_{h=1}^H N_h^2\\frac{s_{U,h}^2}{n_h} - \\sum_{h=1}^H N_hs_{U,h}^2 \\\\ &amp; = \\sum_{h=1}^H N_h^2 \\frac{s_{U,h}^2 \\sum_{l=1}^H N_ls_{U,l}}{N_hs_{U,h} n} - \\sum_{h=1}^H N_hs_{U,h}^2 \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{h=1}^H N_hs_{U,h} \\sum_{l=1}^H N_ls_{U,l} - \\sum_{h=1}^H N_hs_{U,h}^2 \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{1}{n}\\left(\\sum_{h=1}^H N_hs_{U,h}\\right)^2 - \\sum_{h=1}^H N_hs_{U,h}^2. \\\\ \\end{align*}\\] We can prove that, for same sample size \\(n\\), Neyman allocation is more efficient that proportional allocation, that is \\[\\begin{equation} Var_{strt,Ney}(\\widehat{T}_{HT}) \\le Var_{strt,prop}(\\widehat{T}_{HT}). \\tag{3.15} \\end{equation}\\] Proof. Consider \\[\\begin{align*} &amp; Var_{strt,prop}(\\widehat{T}_{HT}) - Var_{strt,Ney}(\\widehat{T}_{HT}) \\\\ &amp; \\qquad = \\frac{N}{n}\\left(1-\\frac{n}{N}\\right)\\sum_{h=1}^HN_hs_{U,h}^2 - \\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\left(\\sum_{h=1}^H N_hs_{U,h}\\right)^2 - \\sum_{h=1}^H N_hs_{U,h}^2\\right) \\\\ &amp; \\qquad = \\frac{N}{n}\\sum_{h=1}^HN_hs_{U,h}^2 - \\sum_{h=1}^HN_hs_{U,h}^2 - \\frac{1}{n}\\left(\\sum_{h=1}^H N_hs_{U,h}\\right)^2 + \\sum_{h=1}^H N_hs_{U,h}^2 \\\\ &amp; \\qquad = \\frac{N}{n}\\sum_{h=1}^HN_hs_{U,h}^2 - \\frac{1}{n}\\left(\\sum_{h=1}^H N_hs_{U,h}\\right)^2 \\\\ &amp; \\qquad = \\frac{N^2}{n}\\left[\\sum_{h=1}^H\\frac{N_h}{N}s_{U,h}^2 - \\left(\\sum_{h=1}^H \\frac{N_h}{N}s_{U,h}\\right)^2\\right] \\\\ &amp; \\qquad = \\frac{N^2}{n}\\sum_{h=1}^H\\frac{N_h}{N}(s_{U,h} - \\bar{s})^2 \\ge 0, \\end{align*}\\] where \\(\\bar{s} = \\sum_{h=1}^N\\frac{N_h}{N}s_{U,h}\\). 3.3.3.3 Comparing to Proportional Allocation Recall that Proportional allocation: \\(n_h \\propto N_h\\) Optimal allocation: \\(n_h \\propto \\frac{N_hs_{U,h}}{\\sqrt{c}_h}\\) So optimal allocation is the same as proportional allocation when \\(s_{U,1} = s_{U,2} = ... = s_{U,H}\\) and \\(c_{U,1} = c_{U,2} = ... = c_{U,H}\\). Note that although it is better than proportional allocation since it is the optimizer, optimal allocation only works for one variable of interest because the allocation depends on \\(s_{U,h}\\), which in turn depends on \\(y_{h,i}\\). Often, in survey sampling, we have more than one variable of interest. For example, not only we are interested in students’ rent payment, but we may also be interested in other expenses as well. If \\(s_{U,h}\\) and \\(c_{U,h}\\) are almost the similar among clusters, the gain in doing optimal allocation is small and we better use proportional allocation. Example 3.8 Suppose we want to sample \\(n = 36\\) students for a survey about test scores. To design this year’s survey, we consider two strata of sizes 1200 and 800, respectively, and we take the means and standard deviations from last year’s survey and get Stratum \\(N_h\\) \\(\\overline{y}_{U,h}\\) \\(s_{U,h}\\) \\(N_h s_{U,h}\\) \\(N_h s_{U,h}^2\\) \\(1\\) \\(1,200\\) \\(60\\) \\(15\\) \\(18,000\\) \\(270,000\\) \\(2\\) \\(800\\) \\(80\\) \\(10\\) \\(8,000\\) \\(80,000\\) Total \\(2,000\\) \\(26,000\\) \\(350,000\\) If we use stratified sampling, proportional allocation: Since \\(n_h = \\frac{n}{N}N_h\\), \\(n_1 = \\frac{36}{2000}\\times 1200 = 21.6 \\approx 22\\) and \\(n_2 = \\frac{36}{2000} \\times 800 = 14.4 \\approx 14\\). \\(Var_{strt, prop}(\\widehat{T}_{HT}) = \\frac{N}{n}\\left(1-\\frac{n}{N}\\right)\\sum_{h=1}^HN_hs_{U,h}^2 = \\frac{2000}{36}\\left(1 - \\frac{36}{2000}\\right)350,000=19,094,444\\). \\(Var_{strt, prop}(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT}) = \\frac{1}{N^2}Var_{strt, prop}(\\widehat{T}_{HT}) = 4.7736\\) If we use stratified sampling, Neyman allocation: Since \\(n_h = \\left(\\frac{N_hs_{U,h}}{\\sum_{l=1}^H N_ls_{U,l}}\\right)n\\), \\(n_1 = \\frac{18,000}{26,000}\\times 36 = 24.9231 \\approx 25\\) and \\(n_2 = \\frac{8,000}{26,000} \\times 36 = 11.0769 \\approx 11\\). \\(Var_{strt, Ney}(\\widehat{T}_{HT}) = \\frac{1}{n}\\left(\\sum_{h=1}^H N_hs_{U,h}\\right)^2 - \\sum_{h=1}^H N_hs_{U,h}^2\\) \\(= \\frac{1}{36}\\times 26,000^2 - 350,000 = 18,427,778\\) \\(Var_{strt, Ney}(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT}) = \\frac{1}{N^2}Var_{strt, Ney}(\\widehat{T}_{HT}) = 4.6069\\) If we use SRS, \\(Var_{SRS}(\\widehat{T}_{HT}) = N^2\\left(1-\\frac{n}{N}\\right)\\frac{s_U^2}{n} = N^2\\left(1-\\frac{n}{N}\\right)\\frac{(SSB+SSW)}{n(N-1)}\\) \\(SSB = \\sum_{h=1}^H N_h(\\overline{y}_{h,U} - \\overline{y}_U)^2 = 1,200 \\times (60-68)^2 + 800 \\times (80-68)^2 = 192,000\\). \\(SSW = \\sum_{h=1}^H (N_h - 1)s_h^2 = 350,000 - 15^2 - 10^2 = 349,675\\) \\(Var_{SRS}(\\widehat{T}_{HT}) = 2000^2\\times \\left(1 - \\frac{36}{2000}\\right)\\frac{192,000 + 349,675}{36\\times 1999} = 29,566,164\\). \\(Var_{SRS}(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT}) = \\frac{1}{N^2}Var_{SRS}(\\widehat{T}_{HT}) = 7.3915\\). 3.3.4 Design Effect The design effect of a complex survey is defined as \\[ DE = \\frac{Var_{complex}(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}})}{Var_{SRS}(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}})} \\] The interpretation of design effect is that we need \\(n / DE\\) observations under SRS to achieve the same variance as in the complex sampling scheme with \\(n\\) observations. We call \\(n / DE\\) the effective sample size. Example 3.9 In Example 3.8, the design effect of stratified sampling with proportional allocation is \\[ \\frac{Var_{strt, prop}(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT})}{Var_{SRS}(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT})} = \\frac{4.7736}{7.3915} =0.6458 \\] This means that we need \\(36/0.65 = 23.4 \\approx 55\\) observations in SRS to achieve the same variance as in the stratified sample with proportional allocation with \\(36\\) observations. The effective sample size here is \\(55\\). 3.3.5 Sample Size Determination Similar to Section 2.9, for proportional allocation, \\[ Var_{strt, prop}(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT}) = \\frac{1}{n}\\left(1-\\frac{n}{N}\\right)\\sum_{h=1}^H\\frac{N_h}{N}s_{U,h}^2 \\] so setting the tolerable margin of error \\(e = z_{\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{Var_{strt, prop}(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT})}\\), we can calculate the sample size to be \\[ n_{prop} = \\frac{\\sum_{h=1}^H\\frac{N_h}{N}s_{U,h}^2}{\\frac{e^2}{z_{\\alpha/2}^2} + \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{h=1}^H\\frac{N_h}{N}s_{U,h}^2} \\] For Neyman allocation, since \\[ Var_{strt, Ney}(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT}) = \\frac{1}{n}\\left(\\sum_{h=1}^H \\frac{N_h}{N}s_{U,h}\\right)^2 - \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{h=1}^H \\frac{N_h}{N}s_{U,h}^2. \\] so setting the tolerable margin of error \\(e = z_{\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{Var_{strt, Ney}(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}_{HT})}\\), we can calculate the sample size to be \\[ n_{Ney} = \\frac{\\left(\\sum_{h=1}^H\\frac{N_h}{N}s_{U,h}\\right)^2}{\\frac{e^2}{z_{\\alpha/2}^2} + \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{h=1}^H\\frac{N_h}{N}s_{U,h}^2}. \\] This is similar to partitioning in mathematics.↩︎ We consider the variance of the HT estimator for the total here because variance of the HT estimator for the mean is just the variance of the HT estimator for the total divided by \\(N^2\\), so minimizing the variance of the HT estimator for the mean is the same as minimizing the variance of HT estimator for the total.↩︎ "],["app-dataset.html", "A Data Set", " A Data Set We will use an artificially generated pseudo data set fakeRentPop.csv as a running example throughout the book. The data set contains information about an artificial population of students’ rent expenses. The variables collected in the data set corresponds to columns in the data set, namely rent: monthly rent expense of the student, which is continuous. study: indicates whether the level of study of the student, which can be either \"Undergrad\", \"Grad\", \"Med Residents\" or \"Non-degree\". This variable is categorical. college: the college affiliation of the student. It can be either \"Agriculture &amp; Bioresources\", \"Arts and Science\", \"Education\", \"Nursing\", \"Kinesiology\", \"Engineering\", \"Public Health\", \"Pharmacy &amp; Nutrition\", \"Medicine\", \"Veterinary Medicine\", \"Business\", \"Law\", \"Public Policy\", \"Environment &amp; Sustainability\", \"Dentistry\", or \"Others\". This variable is categorical. origin: the origin of the student. It can be either \"Saskatchewan\", \"Out of Province\", or \"International\". This variable is categorical. distance: the distance from the rented place to school. It can be either \"less than 15 minutes\", \"15-30 minutes\", \"30-45 minutes\", or \"more than 40 minutes\". This variable is categorical. area: the area of the rented place in \\(m^2\\). This variable is continuous. washroom: whether the rented place has a private washroom. 1 indicates there is a private washroom and 0 otherwise. This variable is binary. neighborhood: neighborhood code of the rented place. This variable is categorical. course: the course that the student attend. This variable is categorical. To read the data set and save it into R working environment as an object called rentPop, use the following code rentPop &lt;- read.csv(&quot;fakeRentPop.csv&quot;) This rentPop object will be used throughout the book.
